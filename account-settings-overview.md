# What is the Account settings workspace?

**Appropriate roles**: Global admin | Account admin | Owner | Manager

Use the Account settings workspace to finish setting up your company's full profile, manage your learning profile, access, programs, file tax exemptions (if appropriate), and more.

All commercial and developer partners access **Account management** in [Partner Center](https://partner.microsoft.com/dashboard/home) by selecting **Settings** (gear), then the **Account settings** workspace.

### When you are in more than one account

For developer accounts, you can check to see if you're part of multiple accounts by the presence of the "account picker" by selecting the profile picture on the top right corner. If you don't see the account picker, you're only part of one account.

When you select this picker, all of the accounts that you're a part of appear as a list. You can select from the list to switch to a different account. Everything that appears is in the context of the selected account.

## Settings

The Account settings menu differs depending on the programs you're enrolled in. For example, if you're a partner in the Cloud Solution Provider program (CSP), you can manage your Azure Shared services from **Account settings**.
