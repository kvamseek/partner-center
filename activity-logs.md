# View or export customer activity logs for more insight into customer transactions

**Appropriate roles**: Admin agent

*Activity logs* provide information about transactions and partner management actions for customers.

Logs for transactions provide detailed information about transactions, including purchased subscriptions.

You can export activity logs as Excel-compatible comma-separated value (.csv) files.

## View and export activity logs

- Each activity log provides a link to the listed customer's **Subscriptions** page.
- A single activity log can show a significant amount of data, such as the ordering of multiple products.
- Each log has the following columns:
  - **Date-Time** — Date and time of the action
  - **Affected customer** — Customer's company name
  - **Action** — Action taken by the customer (for example, *Created a referral*)
  - **Partner user** — Partner associated with the activity

To view and export activity logs, use the following steps:

1. Sign in to [Partner Center](https://partner.microsoft.com/dashboard/home) and select **Settings** (gear)
2. Select **Account settings**, and then select **Activity Log**.
3. Select a down arrow for any activity log to view details about a logged action.
4. Use the **From** and **To** fields to select the time span of the activity log.
   - The default time span is the most recent month.

5. Select **Export log** to copy the customer's subscription data into a .csv file and download it to the default download folder on your computer.
