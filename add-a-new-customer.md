# How to add a new customer record in Partner Center

**Appropriate roles**: Global admin | User management admin | Admin agent | Sales agent

This article describes how to add a new customer record in Partner Center.

A record of a new customer must be added to Partner Center before you can sell subscriptions, manage billing, or provide support to them.

## Considerations

When adding a new customer record in Partner Center:

- **Enter detailed, accurate customer information**: To ease customer verification, ensure that you:
  - Enter the exact legal, official name as it appears in official documents.
  - Avoid using acronyms or short forms.
  - Don't use test names.
  - Provide complete, exact address info (for example, location details, city, state, country/region, and postal or ZIP code).

- **Use the correct registration ID**: When entering your company registration ID, be sure to use your business tax ID and not the customer's personal ID.

- **Confirm Microsoft Customer Agreement**: Before you can place an order on a customer's behalf, you must confirm that they've accepted the [Microsoft Customer Agreement](confirm-customer-agreement.md).

- **Use different steps for *existing* customers**: For existing customers, including customers who already have customer records in Partner Center through a [Multi-channel](multichannel.md) or [Multi-partner](multipartner.md) scenario, [request a relationship with them](request-a-relationship-with-a-customer.md), instead of following the steps here.

- **If your customer is an educational institution**, see [How to create an eduction customer](sell-to-education-customers.md).

- **Enter additional information for some countries/regions**: [Company registration ID and phone number are required for some countries/regions](validate-names-addresses.md) if you're a direct bill partner or an indirect provider

## Add a new customer in Partner Center

To add a new customer, use the following steps:

1. Sign in to [Partner Center](https://partner.microsoft.com/dashboard/home) and select **Customers**.
2. Select **Add customer**.
3. On the **Account info** page, enter the customer's details and primary contact information.

## Validate names and addresses

Your company and email addresses must adhere to many validation rules. See [Validate company names and email addresses](validate-names-addresses.md) for a complete list of these rules.

## Enable Microsoft Cost Management for customer tenant Azure subscriptions

After you add a new customer, you can enable *Microsoft Cost Management* for customer tenant Azure subscriptions. Providing access allows customers to view their costs for Azure consumed services at pay-as-you-go retail rates.

Costs are shown in the customer's billing currency for their consumed usage at Azure RBAC subscription and resource groups scopes.

For more information about how partners can grant access to customers, see [Enable cost management for customer tenant subscriptions](/azure/cost-management-billing/costs/get-started-partners#enable-cost-management-for-customer-tenant-subscriptions).

## Company registration IDs and phone numbers required for some countries/regions

Direct-bill partners and indirect providers adding records for customers in the following countries/regions must also enter the company phone number and registration ID (also known as the organization INN):

- Armenia
- Azerbaijan
- Belarus
- Brazil
- Hungary
- India
- Iraq
- Kazakhstan
- Kyrgyzstan
- Moldova
- Myanmar
- Poland
