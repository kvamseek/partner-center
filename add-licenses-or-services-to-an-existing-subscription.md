# Add licenses or more services to a customer's subscription

**Appropriate roles**: Global admin | User management admin | Admin agent | Sales agent | Helpdesk agent

> [!NOTE]
> This topic describes upgrade options for legacy or traditional license-based subscriptions. Partners can review information on upgrades and transitions using new commerce subscriptions in the [new commerce upgrade documentation](create-a-new-subscription.md#upgrade-for-new-commerce-license-based-subscriptions).

If your customer needs more licenses than their current subscription provides, or if they need a different version with more services, you might be able to upgrade their subscription.

For more information, see [Switch to a different Microsoft 365 Apps for business plan](/microsoft-365/commerce/subscriptions/switch-to-a-different-plan).

## Conditions

Subscriptions can be upgraded if these conditions apply:

- The subscription must be active (not suspended or canceled).

- You must have delegated admin privileges for this customer and service.
  - Learn how to [Request delegated admin privileges](request-a-relationship-with-a-customer.md).

- The customer can't already have subscriptions that include the additional services.

- The customer can't already have the subscriptions you're trying to upgrade them to.

In the last two cases the customer might have purchased their subscriptions or services from another partner or another channel. They won't be able to purchase those subscriptions from you unless they cancel their existing ones first. For more information, see [multi-channel](multichannel.md).

## Upgrade a subscription

To upgrade a subscription, use the following steps:

1. In Partner Center **Home > Customer > Customer list**, select a **Company name.**
2. In the left navigation bar, select **Subscriptions.**

   If a subscription can be upgraded, you'll see an informational icon right after the subscription name.
3. Hover over the informational icon and then select **Upgrade now**.
4. Select the new offer and then select **Submit**.

 More work might be required to transition some user accounts for some services. If so, Partner Center provides a list of accounts and services that were affected. For more information, see [Upgrade to a different Microsoft plan](/microsoft-365/commerce/subscriptions/upgrade-to-different-plan).
