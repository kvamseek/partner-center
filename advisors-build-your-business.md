# Advisors: Build your client base with Office 365 trial invitations and purchase offers

**Appropriate roles**: Advisor

As an authorized Microsoft advisor, **Partner Center** offers you an opportunity to grow your client base and create lasting relationships with your clients. With Partner Center, you can send your clients trial invitations and purchase offers, and to offer them delegated administration services, depending on the services you're authorized to provide.

1. Sign in to [Partner Center](https://partner.microsoft.com/dashboard/home) and select **Customers**.
3. Select **Trials and purchase offers**.

## Create and send trial invitations

> [!NOTE]
> This feature is available only to partners who are authorized subscription advisors.

You can create and send invitations to send to your customers so they can try out Office 365. An invitation can contain a single trial subscription.

If you're certified to offer delegated administration, you can add an option to the trial invitation that allows you to administer the subscription on behalf of your customer. This makes it easier for your customer to try out Office 365.

When you create a trial invitation, a custom URL is created for you. The URL has an embedded code that identifies you as the subscription advisor. You can use this URL for one customer or for multiple customers. You can send the URL to your customer in an email or post it on your website.
For more information about trial invitations, see [Create a trial invitation](advisors-create-a-trial-invitation.md).

## Create and send purchase offers

> [!NOTE]
> This feature is available only to Microsoft Partners who are authorized subscription advisors.

After you send a trial invitation to your customers, follow up with a purchase offer. You can customize an offer so it includes the specific services your customer needs and the correct number of user licenses. If you're certified to offer delegated administration, you can add an option to the purchase offer that allows you to administer the subscription on behalf of your customer.

When you create the purchase offer, a custom URL is created for you. The URL has an embedded code that identifies you as the subscription advisor. You can use this URL for one customer or many customers. Send the URL to your customer in an email or post it on your website.

If your customer wants a different number of licenses, send them a new offer, or they can change the number of licenses when they purchase the subscription.
