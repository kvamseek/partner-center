# Advisors: Create and send a trial invitation for clients to try Office 365

**Appropriate roles**: Advisor

> [!NOTE]
> This feature is available only to Microsoft Partners who are authorized subscription advisors.

You can create and send trial invitations to your clients so they can try out Office 365. When you create a trial invitation, the **Create trial invitation** wizard creates a custom URL for you. The URL has an embedded code that identifies you as the subscription advisor. You can use this URL for one or many clients. Send the URL to your client in an email or use the URL in other documents. The subscription can contain one or more services, depending on the particular offer. An invitation can be sent for only one trial subscription at a time.

If you're certified to offer delegated administration, you can add an option to the trial invitation that allows you to administer the account on behalf of your client. This makes it easier for your client to try out Office 365.

## To create a trial invitation

1. Sign in to [Partner Center](https://partner.microsoft.com/dashboard/home) and select **Customers**.

2. Navigate to **Trials and purchase offers** > **Create invitation**.

3. On the **Create trial invitation** page, select the trial invitation options that you want to include:

    - **Partner office**: If your company has multiple offices, choose the office that you want to associate with this trial invitation.

        To add partner office locations, see [Add a location](manage-locations.md). New office locations may require up to 24 hours after they were created to appear in the Partner office list.

    - **Usage location**: Choose the location where your client will use the services.
    - **Trial subscriptions**: The list of trial subscriptions that you can choose is determined by the usage location of your client's country or region.
    - **Delegated administration**: This option is only available to partners who are certified to offer delegated administration. Choose this option if you want to offer your client delegated administration. If you do, your client can accept the trial invitation with or without acceptance of delegated administration. For more information about delegated administration, see [Offer delegated administration](customers-revoke-admin-privileges.md).

4. Select **Next**.

5. On the**Your trial invitation** page, copy the trial invitation information and URL, and then paste it into an email, a document, or a webpage to create a customized trial invitation.

    > [!NOTE]
    > Make a note of the Trial invitation **summary ID**. Use this ID to track the offer.

6. Personalize your message by including your company logo, introduction, closing remarks, or other information.

7. Send the trial invitation to your client.
