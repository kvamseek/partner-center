# Partners can no longer enroll as advisors

**Appropriate roles**: All CSP partners | Advisor

For partners who planned to sell Office 365 as advisors, this capability is no longer an option. Partners can no longer enroll as Advisors. If a partner is an Advisor today, it is because they enrolled as an Advisor in the past.
Enrolling into CSP (any type of CSP) will override your Advisor status.

## Enrolling in CSP

If you decide to enroll into the CSP program, you won't be able to:

- Create an Office 365 trial offer
- Add clients for an Office 365 trial offer
- Create an Office 365 purchase offer

When you enroll in the CSP program, you can't go back to being an Advisor.
