## <a name="12"></a> Now available: Cancel an Azure subscription by API

Date: December 16, 2022

### Summary

If a customer's Azure plan subscriptions have been compromised, partners can now cancel the Azure subscriptions by API, in addition to being able to cancel them at Partner Center.

### Workspace

Customers

### Impacted audience

Direct-bill partners and indirect providers

### Details

On [November 22, 2022](2022-november.md#29.5) we announced that Partner Center has enabled Global admins with Admin agent roles the ability to cancel Azure subscriptions from Partner Center.

As of December 15, 2022, partners can now cancel their Azure subscription by API.

This capability enables partners with customer Azure subscriptions more control in the event of compromise or abuse. It also enables partners to cancel the Azure subscriptions and the Azure plan directly from the Partner Center, shutting down suspicious activity discovered in their Azure plan subscriptions.

### Next steps

Review the [Azure management documentation](../azure-plan-manage.md#cancel-an-azure-subscription) to find out how to take advantage of this new capability:

* [Azure plan - Manage subscriptions & resources](../azure-plan-manage.md#cancel-an-azure-subscription)
* [Cancel an Azure subscription - Partner Center app developer](/partner-center/develop/cancel-an-azure-subscription)
* [Azure spending - Cancel an Azure entitlement - REST API (Partner Center Rest)](/rest/api/partner-center/azure-spending/cancel-an-azure-entitlement)
* [Get an Azure entitlement for a subscription - Partner Center app developer](/partner-center/develop/get-an-Azure-entitlement-for-a-subscription)
* [Azure spending - Get an Azure entitlement for a subscription - REST API (Partner Center Rest)](/rest/api/partner-center/azure-spending/get-an-azure-entitlement-for-a-subscription)

## <a name="11"></a> Update: Fix for Marketo connector for Marketplace leads expected in February  2023

Date: December 16, 2022

### Summary

Update: [A fix for Marketo connector](2023-february.md#19) has been implemented.

A fix for Marketo connectors for Marketplace leads is expected in February 2023. You can use the workaround described in *Details* until then.

### Workspace

Marketplace offers

### Impacted audience

All partners who have configured Marketo as a lead destination for their Marketplace offers

### Details

As we [announced on November 15, 2022](2022-november.md#23), the Marketo connector configuration for your Marketplace offers in Partner Center isn't working because of a sudden change in the Marketo platform that requires more authentication details from your company.

**Our engineers expect to have a fix for Marketo connector configuration in February, 2023.**

Until then, you can continue to use the following workaround to access leads.

**To access leads:**

1. Sign in to [Partner Center](https://partner.microsoft.com/dashboard/home).
2. Select **Referrals**.
3. Select **Leads** and then **Marketplace Leads**.

* For more information, see [About leads—customer inquiries, marketing-qualified leads, and sales-qualified leads](../manage-leads.md).

* For answers to frequently asked questions about leads, see the [Leads FAQ](../leads-faq.yml).

### Next steps

* [Export leads](../manage-leads.md#exporting-leads) from the Referrals workspace in Partner Center in the meantime, and upload them into your Marketo system.

* Watch for further updates here.

## <a name="10"></a> Removal of legacy Cloud Solution Provider (CSP) seat-based offer partner incentives on December 31

Date: December 15, 2022

### Summary

This announcement is a reminder that legacy CSP incentives for some seat-based offers will end on December 31, 2022.

### Workspace

Incentives

### Impacted audience

CSP direct-bill partners and indirect providers, and resellers through their indirect providers

### Details

As we continue our journey to new commerce, our partner incentives are evolving. We currently offer partner incentives for more than 400 Azure, Microsoft 365, and Dynamics 365 SKUs in new commerce to support partners as they migrate customers to the new experience.

As previously announced, with the new commerce incentives in place, Microsoft will discontinue the legacy incentives for these SKUs on December 31, 2022. You can find a complete list of the affected SKUs in the CSP product addendum on the [partner incentives portal](https://partner.microsoft.com/partnership/partner-incentives).

To continue earning incentives, you must transact these offers in new commerce CSP, with you enrolled in the Microsoft Commerce Incentives (MCI) program and meeting eligibility requirements.

Non-commercial offers included in the CSP product addendum that aren't available in new commerce as of January 1, 2023, will continue to be available through legacy CSP incentives.

Microsoft will continue to pay partner incentives for non-commercial offers that aren't available in new commerce, including Education, Government, and Nonprofit offer IDs, and promotions.

### Next steps

To understand and effectively drive adoption of seat-based offers in the new commerce experience, partners should review and share the available resources with appropriate organizational stakeholders.

* View the [CSP in new commerce journey map](https://partner.microsoft.com/resources/detail/partner-journey-map-journey-to-cloud-solution-provider-new-commerce-pdf).
* Sign in to the [partner website](https://partner.microsoft.com/partnership/partner-incentives) to review the [new commerce experience for CSP seat-based offers collection](https://partner.microsoft.com/resources/collection/new-commerce-experience-for-csp-seat-based-offers#/).
