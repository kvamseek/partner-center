## <a name="24"></a> Important actions partners need to take to secure the partner ecosystem

Date: November 15, 2022

### Summary

Microsoft has included important capabilities and updates to improve partners' security posture and protect your customers' tenants.

### Workspace

Account settings

### Impacted audience

Direct-bill partners, indirect providers, and indirect resellers transacting through the Cloud Solution Provider (CSP) program and with advisors

### Details

To improve the security posture of the partner ecosystem, Microsoft has included several improvements that will be incrementally launched starting today.

**Available now:**

* Customers can now exclude the partner tenant and domain from their Azure Active Directory (Azure AD) conditional access policy. This capability enables partners to continue accessing their customer tenants through granular delegated admin privileges (GDAP) and use the bulk migration tool. For more information, see [Conditional Access for users](/azure/active-directory/external-identities/authentication-conditional-access).

Starting **November 15, 2022:**

* **Email notifications to customers:** No email notifications will be sent to customers when a partner disables a delegated admin privileges (DAP) relationship.

Starting **December 1, 2022:**

* **Subscription cancellation:** Partners will be able to suspend Azure plans and related subscriptions within Partner Center. Further details will be released closer to availability.

Starting **January 17, 2023:**

1. Microsoft will no longer create DAP relationships when a new customer or reseller relationship is created. Partners will need to request GDAP Azure AD roles from customers to manage them.
2. Microsoft will start removing inactive DAP relationships that haven't been used in 90 or more days.

Starting **March 1, 2023:**

1. The [Bulk Migration Tool](../gdap-bulk-migration-tool.md) to upgrade existing DAP connections that were granted by customers to GDAP will no longer be available.
2. Microsoft will begin transitioning active DAP relationships to GDAP with limited Azure AD roles to perform least-privileged customer management activities. Partners should [follow the guidance](../gdap-supported-workloads.md#azure-portal) to continue to have access to Azure subscriptions after the limited roles are granted.

> [!IMPORTANT]
>To avoid disruption to your business, we recommend that you don't delay until March 2023 and act now to transition to GDAP for the level of access that you require to manage your customers. The limited GDAP roles (Directory reader, Global reader, User administrator, License administrator, Service support administrator, Helpdesk administrator) granted by Microsoft during the transition will only allow you to perform least-privilege activities. All other access permissions (such as access to Exchange workloads) will be lost. To perform all other activities, additional GDAP roles must be granted by the customer.

Partners should continue securing their access by transitioning active DAP relationships to GDAP through the following steps:

1. Review the [DAP report](../dap-monitor-self-serve-removal.md) and [remove DAP relationships](../dap-monitor-self-serve-removal.md) that aren't needed.
2. Use the [bulk migration tool](../gdap-bulk-migration-tool.md) to transition to GDAP.
3. [Remove DAP](../dap-monitor-self-serve-removal.md) once transition to GDAP is complete.

We appreciate those efforts and look forward to continuing to work with you to improve the security posture of our ecosystem.

### Next steps

* Sign up for dedicated [CSP Security Q&A sessions](https://globalpbocomm.eventbuilder.com/GranularDelegatedAdminPrivilegesinCSPQASession) to have your queries answered by subject matter experts.
* Review the new [journey map](https://partner.microsoft.com/resources/detail/securing-the-channel-journey-to-zero-trust-pdf) to navigate the transformational journey for partners to Zero Trust. It provides milestones, resources, and actions to take as we continue through this transformation.
* Download the [Security best practices](https://partner.microsoft.com/resources/detail/security-best-practices-for-microsoft-partners-pdf) for partners to learn about the steps you can take today to secure your tenant.
* Find guidance and resources in the Securing the partner and customer ecosystems [partner readiness gallery](https://partner.microsoft.com/resources/collection/granular-delegated-admin-privileges#/).
* Review the [Partner Center security requirements](../partner-security-requirements.md) and the [CSP security best practices](../csp-security-best-practices.md).

## <a name="17"></a> New (beta) API for quickly and asynchronously retrieving unbilled usage data

Date: November 10, 2022

### Summary

Microsoft has introduced a new API model for asynchronously retrieving reconciliation data. The asynchronous API is an innovative way to quickly access reconciliation data in manageable chunks, eliminating the need to loop through millions of transactions for hours iteratively.

We've used a [valet key](/azure/architecture/patterns/valet-key) and [asynchronous request-reply](/azure/architecture/patterns/async-request-reply) patterns to optimize our invoicing and reconciliation APIs to deliver the results asynchronously. You can access the reconciliation data with all or some attributes using a token included in the API response.

### Workspace

Billing

### Impacted audience

All partners

### Details

The following link outlines the steps that should be taken to access the data asynchronously:

[Invoicing and reconciliation API v2 (beta) - Partner Center app developer | Microsoft Learn](/partner-center/develop/get-invoice-billed-unbilled-consumption)

#### Known Limitation

The API is currently enabled to retrieve **unbilled daily rated usage data** in the sandbox and production environment. Remember that the billed daily rated usage API was launched on October 19.

This feature is in beta and might be improved in the future.

### Next steps

Access your billed and unbilled daily rated usage data using this API and compare the results to the results from the current API to ensure accuracy and consistency.

Keep the following points in mind:

* Inform and request developers within your organization to make changes to your existing systems to integrate with this API.

* Endpoints for billed and unbilled usage data are separate.

* The billed and unbilled usage API endpoint is now enabled in both the sandbox and production environments.

### Workspace

Action Center

### Impacted audience

Co-selling partners, Referral admins, alliance managers, partner sellers, and individuals from partner organizations who create referrals in Partner Center

### Details

Microsoft is bringing enhancements to the deal registration experience through which partners have their Azure IP co-sell deals registered and validated. As part of the latest improvements, partners can now export and import the deal registration data via the bulk operations functionality, which can be used by users with either Referrals admin or Referrals user permissions. To learn more about referrals permissions, see [Manage referrals](../permissions-overview.md#manage-referrals).

Take note that the create or update actions done through bulk import aren't reversible. Therefore, exercise caution while modifying or creating multiple IP co-sell deal registration records. Additionally, no actions are permitted after any deal reaches a terminal state, such as approved, passed, failed, or closed.

#### What's new in Partner Center?

Partners can access the new functionalities in the co-sell opportunities page under the import and export links on the command bar of the grid view.

#### Export Azure IP co-sell deal registrations

* A maximum of 5,000 records can be exported by selecting the export button and then Azure IP co-sell deal registration from the drop-down menu.
* In addition to your access levels, the export function considers the current tab in the co-sell opportunities page and the filters that have been applied.
* The downloaded file can be reused to modify the deal details and uploaded to update any records if they are in "action pending" state.

#### Import Azure IP co-sell deal registrations

* A maximum of 1,000 records can be created using the import functionality.
* Partners can either build the template from scratch by downloading the template from the Import page on Partner Center or use the Export functionality to download the existing records and update them.
* After the file is processed, a summary is displayed with the number of deal registration records that were created, updated, and not processed in the last processed file card.
* You can download the details of the processed records, fix any errors, and upload the same file to create or update the records that failed in the previous run. Remove all the successful records from the file before uploading the corrected records that failed in the previous run.

For more information, see [Bulk operations for Co-sell opportunities using comma-separated value (CSV) files](../bulk-operations.md) .

## <a name="6"></a> Now live: Improved customer account matching for inbound referrals

Date: November 3, 2022

### Summary

Improvements to the customer account matching process with clarity on picking customer accounts during referral submission via the bulk upload feature is now live.

### Workspace

Action center

### Impacted audience

Co-selling partners, Referral admins, alliance managers, partner sellers, and individuals from partner organizations who create referrals in Partner Center

### Details

As [previously communicated](2022-may.md#14), Microsoft is improving the customer account section and matching process during inbound referral creation via bulk operations in Partner Center. Users will begin seeing the new functionality rolled out through batched group updates, with all having the new experience live by November 4, 2022.

Partners can use all the benefits of exposing the managed account list for customer selection through the bulk import/export features and can generate multiple referrals in a few steps. These new features will provide a streamlined way for partners to select customer accounts during bulk referral creation with clearly defined managed or unmanaged account status and confidence scores for the final matched account prior to referral creation. Doing so will further contribute to a faster account matching process, reduced expiry rate of referrals, and lower deal registration rejections.

#### What's new in Partner Center?

Referral creation via bulk uploads in Partner Center is now a two-step process:

| Step | Details |
| ----- | ----- |
|**Step 1:**<br> Customer account search | Only two mandatory fields of **Customer Name** and **Customer Country** must be filled in the initial downloaded Excel template before uploading it back to Partner Center. Partners are then presented with a processed file with account match result options upon initial upload. This file holds:<br><br> - One final matched account with high, medium, or low confidence <br> - Two managed, two unmanaged, and two Data Universal Numbers System (DUNS) accounts <br><br>Partners can choose and copy the customer account under the **Final Account Matched** column if they aren't satisfied with the final account match result. |
| **Step 2:**<br> Referral creation | After they choose the final matched account, partners must fill out the rest of the details in the Excel file for the referral creation process and upload the same to Partner Center. <br><br> Take note that it will take between a few seconds to a few minutes to receive the processed file after Step 1, with the customer account results depending on the number of records submitted (maximum of 1000 records).|

> [!IMPORTANT]
> Partners also have the option to create a referral in one step through bulk operations if they have the Microsoft ID information associated with the customer account. To do this, partners must enter the Microsoft ID in the **Final Matched Account** column in the following format: MicrosoftID: Number-Alphanumeric code (for example, MicrosoftID: 6- KOBSAIHVF).

#### Review of previously enabled features from Phase 1

The Microsoft account list is exposed in the Partner Center user interface in addition to the current experience of the DUNS and manual entry. Partners will now see three different tabs in Partner Center when they search for customer accounts during the inbound referral creation process: Microsoft Managed, Microsoft Unmanaged, and Others (DUNS).

| Tab | Description |
| ---- | ------- |
| Microsoft Managed| - The list of accounts matching search criteria and are managed by Microsoft <br>- Deals associated with "Microsoft managed" accounts are eligible for Azure intellectual property (IP) co-sell deal registration, provided they meet other deal registration criteria |
| Microsoft Unmanaged | - The list of accounts matching search criteria but are unmanaged by Microsoft<br>- Deals associated with "Microsoft unmanaged" accounts are NOT eligible for Azure IP co-sell deal registration |
| Others | - The list of accounts from the DUNS list |

Deals associated with "Other" accounts will go through the Microsoft account list matching process. It might take longer, and deal registration will be applicable if the account is matched to a managed account and other criteria are met.

### Next steps

* Review the information to understand the new two-step process and the details on implications of selecting customer accounts from each of the categories.
* Share this communication with the relevant people in your organization.
* This communication is for awareness only. The features and capabilities described in the previous section will be applied automatically.
* For more information on these updates, review the article: [Bulk operations for co-sell opportunities](../bulk-operations.md)

#### Program execution notifications

1. **Updates to POE templates**  
Starting November 1, all claims submitted for Modern Work and Security Build Intent engagements must use the proof of execution (POE) template versions [published on October 1](https://aka.ms/mci/workshops). Older versions won't be accepted for approval after November 1, regardless of the claim creation date or customer consent date, so ensure that you visit the [MCI Workshops](https://aka.ms/MCIWorkshops) page to download and review the latest delivery material ahead of each workshop.
