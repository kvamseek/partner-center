# February 2023 announcements

This page provides the announcements for Microsoft Partner Center for February 2023.

## <a name="23"></a> Updates to NCE license-based preview price list

Date: February 27, 2023

### Summary

Starting in March 2023, the NCE license-based *preview* (April 2023) price list will include more types of product changes.

### Workspace

Pricing

### Impacted audience

Cloud Solution Provider partners--indirect providers and direct bill—in all markets/countries/regions

### Details

Previously, the NCE license-based price *preview* price list captured changes for products at an overall product-sku level. However, not all NCE products are configured in the same manner, and this led to inconsistency in when or if products would appear in a preview.

Going forward, the NCE license-based *preview* price list will include a broader and more holistic set of data changes. Each time a product experiences a change to its data—whether it’s a price, description, or other change—the product will appear in a preview price list. \*

The look and feel of the preview price list, its data schema, remains the same. Partners should continue to use the NCE license-based preview price list to discover:

- new products with a preview period (please note some products bypass preview and go directly to general availability)
- products reaching an End-of-Sales date and lifecycle state
- price changes

> [!NOTE]
> \* It’s important to note that with month-over-month comparison, many product data changes will be evident. However, it is possible for product preview data to appear unchanged from month to month. When data appears identical month-over-month, this is because the product is experiencing some data change, though the change is not to data attributes present in the pricing data set.

### Next steps

- Attend — or catch the recording — of a [March 8, 2023, CSP Technical Training](https://globalpbocomm.eventbuilder.com/event/67691?source=CSPTechnicalTraining) to learn more about changes to the NCE license-based preview price list.

- If there is an impact to your organization, please share this information with the appropriate contacts in your company.

- Reference the latest pricing guidance on [Pricing and offers](../pricing-and-offers.md).

- Looking for more about local currency pricing updates related to the preview price list? Check out our [partner resources](https://partner.microsoft.com/resources/collection/local-currency-pricing-updates-for-eu-efta#/).

## <a name="17"></a> New timelines and important actions to secure the partner ecosystem

Date: February 15, 2023

### Summary

Microsoft is extending previously announced timelines for actions partners should take to secure their customers.

### Workspace

Account settings

### Impacted audience

Direct bill partners, indirect providers, and indirect resellers transacting through the Cloud Solution Provider (CSP) program and with advisors

### Details

Partners should continue securing their access by transitioning existing delegated admin privileges (DAP) relationships to granular delegated admin privileges (GDAP) by reviewing the [DAP monitoring report](../dap-monitor-self-serve-removal.md#dap-monitoring-and-self-service-removal) and [removing DAP relationships](../dap-monitor-self-serve-removal.md) that aren't needed.

#### New GDAP milestone dates

1. **Transition active and inactive DAPs: Starting May 22, 2023**
    * Microsoft will begin transitioning active and inactive DAP relationships to GDAP with limited Azure Active Directory (AD) roles. We will provide clarity on the roles by March 15, 2023.
    * For relationships that have been transitioned from DAP to GDAP, we will proceed to remove the corresponding DAP relationships 30 days later.
    * We will pause the transition for the month of June to support the fiscal year closure.
  
    > [!NOTE]
    > If a partner has a GDAP relationship with a specific customer, Microsoft will not transition that customers DAP to GDAP. Microsoft will disable that customer’s DAP by the end of July.

2. **The dates for the following milestones will be communicated on March 15, 2023:**
    * **Stop new DAPs**—DAP is currently granted when a new customer tenant is created. Microsoft will no longer grant DAP for new customer creation.
    * **Grant GDAP default roles for new customers**—GDAP with certain default roles will be granted when a new customer tenant is created.
    * **Retire the bulk migration tool**—The bulk migration tool will be retired.

#### Available now

1. [Bulk migration tool](../gdap-bulk-migration-tool.md): New DAP removal feature
    * Starting **February 15, 2023**, the tool will have a new feature that allows partners to remove DAP relationships in bulk.
    * The tool will also be able to carry out bulk editing, deletion of access assignments, and deletion of GDAP relationships. For more details, go to [GDAP bulk migration tool](../gdap-bulk-migration-tool.md).
2. The **GDAP v1 APIs** are now available. We recommend moving from [beta](/graph/api/resources/delegatedadminrelationships-api-overview?view=graph-rest-beta&preserve-view=true) to [v1.0](/graph/api/resources/delegatedadminrelationships-api-overview?view=graph-rest-1.0&preserve-view=true) as soon as possible.
3. It was required that every privileged access group (formerly called PIM for Groups feature) had to be a role-assignable group. **This restriction has now been removed.** It’s now possible to enable more than 500 groups per tenant in PIM; however only up to 500 groups can be role assignable. For more information, refer to [Privileged Identity Management (PIM) for Groups (preview) - Azure Active Directory](/azure/active-directory/privileged-identity-management/concept-pim-for-groups).
4. You should [add a security contact now](../security-contact.md) to receive Azure fraud notification emails. These emails are currently being sent to the admin agents, but if an admit agent is just-in-time (JIT) enabled and the JIT expires, the email won’t be delivered. Hence, having a security contact will help detect and protect Azure fraud events. Learn more about [handling Azure fraud notifications](../azure-fraud-notification.md#what-to-do-when-you-receive-a-security-alert-notification). We recommend investigating and [updating the fraud event status](../developer/update-fraud-events-status.md).

#### Exchange Online Automation to be deprecated on March 31, 2023

Any code that incorporates either the Legacy Exchange Online public client ID (app ID `a0c73c16-a7e3-4564-9a95-2bdf47383716`) or the Partner Center PowerShell module will cease to function on March 31, 2023. We recommend that you immediately review code or automation to locate any use of this legacy public client ID. You can find more details on steps that you need to take in the [January security announcement](./2023-january.md#13).

#### Security Through the Lens of Zero Trust

[Sign up for a two-day seminar](https://vshow.on24.com/vshow/Security_Depth/registration/22777) to learn the security features and capabilities available within Microsoft Azure and Microsoft 365 that can help your customers easily protect their identity, network, and infrastructure workloads hosted in hybrid and cloud environment. This training is also available as [on-demand learning](https://vshow.on24.com/vshow/Security_Depth/registration/22542).

#### Resolved: Access issues with Azure Services using Azure GDAP

Some partners might have been experiencing access issues when partner technicians administer Azure services for their customers on Azure portal using admin on behalf of (AOBO). This was due to double-byte character sets (DBCS) entered in **the Partner Organization Name** field. We can confirm that this issue has now been **resolved** and encourage you to continue your transition to GDAP.

### Next steps

1. Strengthen your security posture and navigate the evolving threat landscape with Microsoft cybersecurity [tools and resources](https://partner.microsoft.com/partnership/partner/security).
2. Review the [Partner Center security requirements](../partner-security-requirements.md) and [the CSP security best practices](../csp-security-best-practices.md).

## <a name="16"></a> Price list data update to “Unit of measure”

Date: February 15, 2023

### Summary

Partner Center’s pricing service will update its logic for *Unit of Measure*.

### Workspace

Pricing

### Impacted audience

Cloud Solution Provider (CSP) direct-bill partners and indirect providers who use modern Azure or marketplace pricing

### Details

Beginning in March 2023, Partner Center’s pricing service will update its logic for *Unit of Measure*, which is a concept common to usage-based services. Previously this field had many possible measurement values, and after the change is made, the field will have a smaller set of values with more consistency across the products and the services to which it applies. See the below table for a summary of which price lists contain this field, and the impact to these
price lists due to this update.

| Price list impact summary         |              Price list impact summary      |
|---------------------------------------|-----------------------------------------|
| **Category**                          | **Unit of measure values changing?**    |
| License-based services (New commerce) | No impact, values are always blank.     |
| Software                              | No impact, values are always blank.                                        |
| Azure plan consumption                | Yes, there is impact. See example data. |
| Azure plan reservations               | Yes, there is impact. See example data.                                        |
| Marketplace                           |  Yes, there is impact. See example data.                                       |

| Sample data\* for Unit of measure                                 |      Sample data\* for Unit of measure             |
|-----------------------------------------------------------------------|-------------------|
| **BEFORE change**                                                     |  **AFTER change** |
| 1 Compute Hour</br> \# of assets</br> Per 1000 units                  | 1 hour </br>1/year     |

\*These are possible values and are not representative of all values.


### Next steps

- Cloud Solution Provider (CSP) direct-bill partners and indirect providers who use modern Azure or marketplace pricing will need to review if or how they use the “Unit of measure” attribute and determine if any change to their pricing processes is required. This is believed to be a no- to low-impact change for most organizations.
- If there is an impact to your organization, please share this information with the appropriate contacts in your company.
- Reference the latest pricing data schema and example data on [Microsoft Docs | Pricing and offers](../pricing-and-offers.md#new-commerce-price-list).

## <a name="4"></a> Azure spending notifications are temporarily unavailable if you bought Azure Savings Plans

Date: February 1, 2023

### Summary

If you bought Azure Savings Plans for your customers, even though you set budgets for their customers, you temporarily can't get Azure spending notifications.

That means you won’t know how much your customers spend on Azure in real time. Instead, you'll have to keep track of how and how much your customers use Azure resources.

We're working hard to fix this problem and restore spending alerts soon as possible.

We expect notifications to be restored by **middle of March 2023**.

### Workspace

Billing

### Impacted audience

All partners

### Details

Due to a technical problem with our internal processing system, if you bought Azure Savings Plans for your customers, even if you set budgets, you temporarily won't get Azure spending notifications.

Not getting those notifications could make it difficult for you to manage Azure resources for your customers because you won’t be able to see how much is being spent in real time.

We're working hard to fix this problem and get spending alerts back as soon as possible. In the meantime, we encourage you to think of other ways to keep track of your customers’ usage on Azure. For example, you could regularly review unbilled usage data for cost spikes.

**To get more information about your Azure Savings Plans:**

* Use the **API** to get a list of your unbilled line items. For more information about how to do so, see [Get invoice's unbilled reconciliation line items](../developer/get-invoice-unbilled-recon-lineitems.md).

* Go to the **Billing** workspace in Partner Center and select **Billing history.** Then, download the **Reconciliation-recent activity** report in the **Estimates** section.

* Check the **Azure portal** for the Azure Savings Plans you've purchased. For more information, see [Manage Azure savings plans](/azure/cost-management-billing/savings-plan/manage-savings-plan).

We apologize for any trouble this technical problem causes you, and we appreciate your patience while we work to fix it. If you have any questions or concerns, don’t hesitate to reach out to our support team for assistance.

### Next steps

Because Azure spending notifications are temporarily unavailable, you can take the following steps to lessen the impact:

* **Manually monitor Azure usage and costs**: Check unbilled daily rated usage data regularly to ensure that you know how much your customers are spending on Azure resources. If you see abnormal usage, you should address it immediately. You can access the data using APIs either [synchronously](../developer/get-invoice-unbilled-consumption-lineitems.md) or [asynchronously](../developer/get-invoice-billed-unbilled-consumption.md), but we recommend that you use the asynchronous method for the fastest response.  

   You can also download the file at your own pace at Partner Center. For information about how to download the file, see [Download reconciliation files asynchronously](../use-the-reconciliation-files.md).

* **Use the Azure portal to set up budgets**: You can set up a customer budget in the Azure portal just like you can in Partner Center. For more information, see [Tutorial - Create and manage Azure budgets](/azure/cost-management-billing/costs/tutorial-acm-create-budgets).

   If that means more work for you, use the data on unbilled usage until we restore notification back in Partner Center.

* **Communicate with customers**: Proactively communicate with your customers about the temporary unavailability of spending notifications and suggest alternative methods for monitoring Azure usage and costs.

We're committed to fixing this problem as soon as possible so that the spending notifications can be restored. In the meantime, follow the preceding steps to make it easier to manage Azure resources for your customers.

We expect notifications to be restored by the **middle of March 2023**.
