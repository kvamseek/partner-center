To get a complete list of current promotions (both traditional, license-based commerce and new commerce) download the [Global Promotions Readiness Guide](https://partner.microsoft.com/resources/detail/operations-promo-guide-pdf).

## <a name="13"></a> New timelines: Important actions partners must take to secure the partner ecosystem

Date: January 12, 2023

### Summary

Microsoft is extending the previously announced timelines for key actions by partners to secure their ecosystems.

### Workspace

Account settings

### Impacted audience

Direct-bill partners, indirect providers, and indirect resellers transacting through the Cloud Solution Provider (CSP) program and with advisors

### Details

#### Granular delegated admin privileges (GDAP) and delegated admin privileges (DAP) milestone updates

We’re making some shifts in the GDAP timeline. We'll provide an update on the new schedule by February 15, 2023. We'll give at least a 60-day notice period before the milestone date.

**These shifts in the timeline are related to two key items:**

* **Double-byte character**
  We’ve identified the following issue: If a customer tenant name has a double-byte character, GDAP won't work.
* **Default GDAP roles**
  Partners have requested default Azure Active Directory (Azure AD) roles when creating a new customer tenant. Microsoft is designing this feature.

#### GDAP milestones shifting

* **Stop new DAPs:** DAP is currently granted when a new customer tenant is created. Microsoft will no longer grant DAP for new customer creation.
* **Transition inactive DAPs:** Microsoft will start transitioning DAP relationships that haven't been used in 90 or more days to GDAP with limited Azure AD roles. To review which relationships are inactive, use the [DAP monitoring report](../dap-monitor-self-serve-removal.md).
* **Transition active DAPs:** Microsoft will begin transitioning active DAP relationships to GDAP with limited Azure AD roles.

#### GDAP/DAP coming in February

[Bulk migration tool:](../gdap-bulk-migration-tool.md) Bulk DAP removal feature

This tool will have a new feature that allows partners to remove DAP relationships in bulk starting **February 15, 2023**.

#### Available now

* On January 9, 2023, Microsoft enhanced the capabilities of detecting and notifying Azure fraud alerts.
  * Partners will be able to register a new webhook, *azure-fraud-event-detected*, in [Partner Center webhook events](../developer/partner-center-webhook-events.md).
  * The Partner Center webhook APIs allow partners to register for resource change events. These events are delivered in the form of HTTP POSTs to the partner's registered URL.
  * To receive an event from Partner Center, partners will host a callback where Partner Center can POST the resource change event. The event will be digitally signed so that the partner can verify that it was sent from Partner Center.
* Partners will now be able to see Azure fraud events in the activity logs.
  **To see fraud events in the activity logs:**
  1. Sign in to [Partner Center](https://partner.microsoft.com/dashboard/home) and select the Settings (gear) icon on the upper-right corner, and then select **Account settings**.
  2. Go to the activity log and select **Azure Fraud Event Detected** as operation type
    Recent Azure fraud alerts that are affected are displayed.

#### Launching towards the end of January 2023

A security contact can start receiving Azure fraud emails. Today, emails are sent to Admin agents, but if an Admin agent is just-in-time (JIT) enabled and the JIT expires, the email won't be delivered. Therefore, having a security contact will help detect and protect Azure fraud events.

To enable a security contact for your organization, see [Cloud Solution Provider security contact](../security-contact.md).

#### Exchange Online automation affecting change on March 31, 2023

The Legacy Exchange Online Public Client ID (app ID a0c73c16-a7e3-4564-9a95-2bdf47383716) will be retired on March 31, 2023.

This public client ID is also known as the ExO PowerShell public client.

The legacy public client was previously used by the open-source [Partner Center PowerShell](/powershell/partnercenter/overview?view=partnercenterps-3.0&viewFallbackFrom=partnercenterps-3.0&preserve-view=true) module ([GitHub here](https://github.com/microsoft/Partner-Center-PowerShell)).

Any code that incorporates either the legacy public client (a0c73c16-a7e3-4564-9a95-2bdf47383716) or the Partner Center PowerShell module will cease to function on March 31, 2023.

You can find further details, including information on how to prepare for this event, under [Additional information](#additional-information) in the following section.

#### Additional information

This section provides additional information related to the retirement of the legacy Exchange online public client)

Microsoft recommends that partners review any code or automation to locate any use of the legacy public client ID (app ID a0c73c16-a7e3-4564-9a95-2bdf47383716).

We’re aware of cases where developers have used the open-source PowerShell module sources as an implementation reference for proprietary automation.

It's further possible that the use of the **public client ID may not be obviously related to Exchange Online use cases**. That means it’s possible that **any code derived** from the ExO or Partner Center PowerShell might also cease to function when the legacy public client is retired.

It’s important that the code searches for this risk focus on the public client ID and the use of ExO or Partner Center PowerShell module as published.

The Partner Center PowerShell module isn't supported by Microsoft but is supported by the community.

#### How to prepare for this event

1. Search automation code for the use of this client ID (app ID a0c73c16-a7e3-4564-9a95-2bdf47383716).
2. Any code using that client ID **immediately migrates to the modern** [Exchange Online PowerShell V3 module](/powershell/exchange/exchange-online-powershell-v2?view=exchange-ps&preserve-view=true). (Install from the PowerShell gallery as described in the [Exchange Online PowerShell module](/powershell/exchange/connect-to-exchange-online-powershell?view=exchange-ps&preserve-view=true#connect-to-exchange-online-powershell-in-customer-organizations).)

   * The Exchange Online PowerShell module provides a modern superset of functionality for the full Exchange Online product.
  
   * You can find guidance about how to use the Exchange PowerShell V3 module in unattended scripts in [App-only authentication in Exchange Online PowerShell and Security and Compliance PowerShell](/powershell/exchange/app-only-auth-powershell-v2?view=exchange-ps&preserve-view=true#step-1-register-the-application-in-azure-ad).

* Review the [Partner Center security requirements](../partner-security-requirements.md) and [the CSP security best practices](../csp-security-best-practices.md).
* Sign up for dedicated [CSP Security Q&A sessions](https://globalpbocomm.eventbuilder.com/GranularDelegatedAdminPrivilegesinCSPQASession) to have your questions answered by subject matter experts.
* Review the new [journey map](https://partner.microsoft.com/resources/detail/securing-the-channel-journey-to-zero-trust-pdf) to navigate the transformational journey for partners to Zero Trust. It provides milestones, resources, and actions to take as we continue with this transformation.

## <a name="9"></a> Microsoft Teams Premium preview now available

Date: January 10, 2023

### Summary

Teams Premium preview is now available. IT admins can enroll in the trial through the [Microsoft 365 Admin Center](https://admin.microsoft.com/Adminportal/Home#/catalog) and activate a free Teams Premium licensing trial.

### Workspace

General

### Impacted audience

Solution Provider (CSP) partners

### Details

**On December 16, Microsoft announced that Microsoft Teams Premium is broadly available for preview as a limited trial for commercial customers** through the Microsoft 365 Admin Center.

The features under this offering began rolling out last December and will continue to roll out through January. General availability of Teams Premium is scheduled for early February 2023.

Teams Premium makes every meeting—from one-on-ones, to large meetings, to virtual appointments, to webinars—more personalized, intelligent, and secure.

With Teams Premium, customers can:

* Extend their organization’s brand and company culture across meetings with branding, organization backgrounds, and organization *Together mode* scenes.

* Use AI to make the meetings they attend (or miss) more productive and impactful through:
  * Live translation of captions to remove language barriers
  * Intelligent recap features that offer smarter recordings with autogenerated chapters
  * AI-suggested action items
  * Insights to quickly catch up on missed meetings where their name was mentioned

* Apply advanced meeting protection such as:
  * Watermark
  * End-to-end encryption for meetings
  * Sensitivity labels for meetings with prevent copy/paste of meeting chat to better protect your virtual meetings

* Deliver a high-quality webinar experience through:
  * Advanced capabilities to streamline event workflows with registration waitlist and manual approval
  * Facilitating behind-the-scene actions through virtual greenroom for presenters (separate from attendees) before the event begins
  * Managing the attendee experience so they only see shared content and participants brought on-screen

* Manage the end-to-end virtual appointment experience with:
  * Advanced features like text reminders
  * Custom-branded virtual appointments
  * Centralized Virtual Appointment dashboard for a quick view into schedules, queues, and analytics to keep track of key usage insights such as no-shows and wait time information per appointment

#### Steps to support your customers to enroll in the preview

Partners can start sharing the news with their customers to start enrolling tenants in the preview as a trial through the [Microsoft 365 Admin Center](https://admin.microsoft.com/Adminportal/Home#/catalog) by searching for *Teams Premium* in the catalog. Once enrolled and activated, tenant admins receive a limited number of 30-day trial licenses that they can assign to users in their organization.  

Admins can also enroll in the public preview to gain access to Teams Premium features—such as understanding the configuration options for the capabilities or assessing how they'll be used in their environment—without assigning the trial licenses to end users.

If a user is assigned an expired Teams Premium trial license, they won't have access to those Teams Premium features. Similar to user license assignment, after the public preview duration has expired, IT admins lose access to these features.

General

### Impacted audience

All partners, especially partners qualified to deliver Microsoft Solution Assessments

### Details

The Holistic Business Case (HBC) Solution Assessment type was originally a Microsoft field seller-driven offering that partners had limited ability to initiate, influence, or conduct on their own.

The new *HBC Partner-Led* model enables qualified partners to use Partner Center to nominate their own customers for HBC engagements and then run those engagements end to end.

The Microsoft HBC is a type of Microsoft Solution Assessment for Azure that uses special tooling to uncover multiple business cases (customer opportunities) for a given account.

You can think of HBC as a way of helping customers better understand their environment and look holistically at migration and modernization opportunities across databases, infrastructure, and applications.

For more information, see the [Holistic Business Case collection](https://partner.microsoft.com/asset/collection/data-optimization-assessment#/).

> [!NOTE]
> *HBC Partner-Led* is included in the Microsoft Solution Assessment Incentive Program guide.

### Next steps

* Familiarize yourself with the HBC model, readiness requirements, and statement of work (SOW) using the *HBC Partner-Led Execution Guide* and related assessment resources.
* Become trained on one of the HBC customer scanning engines (UnifyCloud, Dr Migrate or Azure Migrate) prior to nominating/conducting an HBC.
* Once trained, start nominating your customers with cross-workload use cases and begin conducting HBC engagements.
* Reach out to your local Microsoft Solution Assessment team for other support requirements.

## <a name="1"></a> Enhancements to Partner Center new commerce migrations

Date: January 4, 2023

### Summary

A few enhancements are now available in Partner Center for new commerce migration experiences.

### Workspace

Customers

### Impacted audience

Direct-bill partners and indirect providers

### Details

The ability for partners to migrate their traditional license-based subscriptions to new commerce was made available in March 2022. Since then, various enhancements have been made to the experiences and new support for offer migration. Two recent enhancements:

1. **Add-on migration:** Until now, partners could only migrate add-ons along with their base subscriptions. This limitation has been removed and partners can now migrate add-ons independently of their base subscriptions. This new capability is currently available only using the Partner Center APIs. Support for add-on only migrations will be available in the Partner Center user interface experiences in the coming months. More about add-on migration can be found in the [migration how to documentation add-ons section](../migrate-subscriptions-to-new-commerce.md#migrating-subscriptions-with-add-ons).

2. **Up-to-date migration data:** Partners can discover new commerce product SKUs that are compatible with their traditional license-based subscriptions by using the offer list matrix. This data file, available in the Pricing and offers section of partner center, includes a **NCE Mapping** sheet. We've recently updated this data to ensure accuracy and have added an extra column **Migration enabled** so partners know which offers support the easy of use migration capabilities in Partner Center portal and APIs. More about migration mapping and migration capabilities can be found in the [migration how to topic mapping section](../migrate-subscriptions-to-new-commerce.md#mapping-legacy-offers-to-new-commerce-experience).

### Next steps

Review the Partner Center [migration how to topic](../migrate-subscriptions-to-new-commerce.md) to find out more about migrating to new commerce.
