## <a name="18"></a> Introducing Microsoft 365 Copilot — your copilot for work

Date: March 30, 2023

### Summary

On March 16, 2023, we announced the private preview of Microsoft 365 Copilot.

### Workspace

General

### Impacted audience

All Microsoft partners; don't redistribute directly to customers

### Details

**On March 16, 2023, we announced the private preview of Microsoft 365 Copilot**. Copilot combines into a single system the power of next-generation AI, the richness of individual user data—calendar, emails, chats, documents, meetings, and more—in Microsoft Graph, plus the Microsoft 365 apps that people use every day. And it does so within Microsoft's existing commitments to data security and privacy in the enterprise.

Microsoft 365 Copilot isn't just a better way of doing the same things. It's an entirely new way of working. The announcement and additional information are in the latest [official Microsoft blog post](https://aka.ms/M365Copilot/OMB).

Copilot works alongside users in two ways:

1. **Copilot works alongside the user, embedded in the Microsoft 365 apps they use every day**—Word, Excel, PowerPoint, Outlook, Teams, and more—to unleash creativity, unlock productivity, and level up skills.

2. **Copilot also powers Microsoft 365 Business Chat, an entirely new experience** that taps into the power of Microsoft Graph in real time, working across all of a user's Microsoft 365 apps and data—calendar, emails, chats, documents, meetings, and contacts—to do things they've never been able to do before.

Together, this means your customers can spend less time searching for the right document or piece of information, struggling to get started on a task, moving from tool to tool, and more time doing—creating, collaborating, innovating.

**Copilot isn't just a better way of doing the same things—it's an entirely new way of working** that will transform productivity. Microsoft 365 Copilot can understand, summarize, analyze, organize, collaborate, communicate, create, and automate using a user's specific business content and context.

**In your conversations with customers**, be sure to reaffirm Microsoft's commitments to data security and privacy, and to underscore key points of differentiation:

- **Grounded in users' business data.** Copilot uses cutting-edge AI to help users work across their business data in a secure, compliant, privacy-preserving way—delivering accurate, relevant, contextual results. Copilot large language models (LLMs) are not trained on your customers' tenant data. Their data never leaves its secure partition.

- **No change to Microsoft's existing commitments to data security and privacy in the enterprise.** Copilot automatically inherits your customers' security, compliance, and privacy policies for Microsoft 365. At an individual user level, Copilot works like enterprise search today: it can access only the data to which the user already has access, enforced by the same technology that we've been using for years to secure customer data in Microsoft 365 apps.

- **Integrated into the apps people use every day.** Microsoft 365 Copilot is deeply integrated in the productivity apps millions of people use and rely on every day for work and life—Word, Excel, PowerPoint, Outlook, Teams, and more.

- **The individual user—and the admins—is always in control.** Users decide what to use, modify, or discard. We will share more soon about new tools for IT admins so that they can plan with confidence to enable Copilot across their organizations.

- **Building responsibly.** Microsoft 365 Copilot is designed for the needs of the enterprise. Our efforts are guided by our [AI principles](https://www.microsoft.com/ai/our-approach) and [Responsible AI Standard](https://query.prod.cms.rt.microsoft.com/cms/api/am/binary/RE5cmFl), and build on decades of research about grounding and privacy-preserving machine learning.

#### Frequently asked questions

> [!NOTE]
> An extended set of frequently asked questions is currently available. If you don't find your question here, [review the full FAQ document](https://aka.ms/M365Copilot/partner-FAQ).

- **Is there an early adopter program for Microsoft partners?**

    We've started with a limited private preview across a selection of customers and will expand over the coming months. We'll share information about any programs as they are developed.

- **My customer is an S500 account and would like to start testing the services. How can I enroll them?**

    Private previews are currently limited and not open for nominations. We will provide updates if and when this changes.

- **When will these experiences be generally available (GA)?**

    Today, we're announcing the beginning of our journey to reinvent how people work. As part of that, we're starting with a limited private preview and will provide additional details to our partners and customers about broader availability of these features at a future date.

- **Which plans or licenses will include the Copilot functionality?**

    Microsoft 365 is foundational to being AI-ready. Microsoft 365 E3/E5 (and Microsoft 365 Business Standard/Business Premium) will be a licensing requirement for these AI capabilities in the future. We will announce pricing and licensing details in the coming months.

## <a name="15"></a> The new commerce reconciliation file download experience is now asynchronous!

Date: March 24, 2023

### Summary

We are excited to announce that our **New Commerce** reconciliation file download experience is now asynchronous! This means that you can download the files in the background while you continue working on other tasks. No more waiting for downloads to finish before you can start working!

### Workspace

Billing

### Impacted audience

All partners

### Details

This new feature is a major improvement over the previous system. Previously, you had to wait for the entire file download process to be completed before accessing your file. This can be a frustrating experience, especially with large files. With the new asynchronous process, you can now initiate the file download and continue with other tasks while the download runs in the background.
The new experience is not only faster, but it also provides you with more flexibility and convenience. You can now initiate multiple downloads simultaneously and continue with work without any interruptions.

We are confident that this upgrade will enhance the overall user experience for our customers. We are committed to continually improving our services and providing the best possible experience for our users.

For more information about the new commerce reconciliation file download experience, please see [Use your reconciliation files](/partner-center/use-the-reconciliation-files#where-do-i-download-the-file-asynchronously).

#### Known limitation

New Commerce reconciliation files can only be downloaded asynchronously. Legacy and other file types are downloaded synchronously.

### Next steps

**Start downloading files in the background while you continue working on other tasks.** This will save you a significant amount of time and frustration.

**Keep an eye on the download progress bar to see how far along the files are.** This will help you to plan your workflow and ensure that you have the files you need when you need them.

**Once a file has finished downloading, you can open it immediately.** This will save you from having to wait for the download to finish before you can start working.

**If you have any questions or problems, please contact the Support team.** They will be happy to help you with anything you need.

## <a name="10"></a> Improved co-sell experiences for Services partners

Date: March 16, 2023

### Summary

Microsoft is working on a set of changes to improve coselling for services partners, changes in Partner center Referrals workspace.

### Workspace

Referrals

### Impacted audience

Services Partners who have Microsoft AI Cloud Partner Program designations, such as Azure Expert MSP, Specializations or Solutions Partner designations

### Details

Microsoft is working on a set of changes to improve coselling for Services partners. Referrals will be sent to some Services partners without referencing the solution published in the marketplace, making the process easier for Microsoft sellers as the first release. Partners can receive and accept opportunities with the same workflows in Partner Center. Additionally, we'll be adding two new fields, Partner role and Partner program, to the co-sell opportunity. This will help partners identify leads from specific GTM programs.

In a few months, we'll enable a Partner sharing workflow specifically for Services partners, which will also remove the restrictions of attaching a services solution and transition from the old to the new workflows completely. There will be no impact to the Azure IP Co-sell sharing workflows.

### Next steps

No immediate action is needed from partners. Please look out for future announcements about more enhancements to partner sharing workflows.

## <a name="9"></a> Security update: Important actions to secure the partner ecosystem

Date: March 15, 2023

### Summary

Important capabilities and updates to improve your security posture and protect your customers' tenants are now available.

### Workspace

Account settings

### Impacted audience

Direct bill partners, indirect providers, and indirect resellers transacting through the Cloud Solution Provider (CSP) program and with advisors

### Details

> [!IMPORTANT]
> Partners should continue securing their access by:
>
> 1. **Requesting granular delegated admin privileges (GDAP)**—If admin access is required for a customer tenant, the partner (with the admin agent role within the partner organization) should request, and the customer should [approve a GDAP relationship](../gdap-customer-approval.md) with the appropriate Azure Active Directory (AD) roles.
> 2. **Disabling delegated admin privileges (DAP)**—If admin access isn't required, the partner (with the admin agent role within the partner organization) should review the [DAP monitoring report](../dap-monitor-self-serve-removal.md#dap-monitoring-and-self-service-removal) and [disable DAP relationships](../dap-monitor-self-serve-removal.md) immediately. If admin access is needed, the partner should complete the GDAP setup and then disable DAP.

#### GDAP milestones

We appreciate your patience as we continue to work towards finalizing dates for the following GDAP milestones, which will honor a 60-day notice before the milestone date.

* **Creating new customers**—DAP is currently granted when a new customer tenant is created. Microsoft will no longer grant DAP for new customer creation and will instead grant GDAP with certain default roles when a new customer tenant is created.
* **Retirement of bulk migration tool**—The tool that allows bulk removal of DAP and GDAP creation will eventually be retired.

#### Transition from DAP to GDAP

As [communicated in February 2023](2023-february.md#17), transition from DAP to GDAP will begin on May 22, 2023. Microsoft will begin transitioning DAP relationships to GDAP roles, as listed:

1. [Directory readers](/azure/active-directory/roles/permissions-reference#directory-readers)—can read basic directory information; commonly used to grant directory read access to applications and guests
2. [Directory writers](/azure/active-directory/roles/permissions-reference#directory-writers)—can read and write basic directory information; for granting access to applications, not intended for users
3. [License administrator](/azure/active-directory/roles/permissions-reference#license-administrator)—can manage product licenses on users and groups
4. [Service support administrator](/azure/active-directory/roles/permissions-reference#service-support-administrator)—can read service health information and manage support tickets
5. [User administrator](/azure/active-directory/roles/permissions-reference#user-administrator)—can manage all aspects of users and groups, including resetting passwords for limited admins
6. [Privileged role administrator](/azure/active-directory/roles/permissions-reference#privileged-role-administrator)—can manage role assignments in Azure AD and all aspects of Privileged Identity Management (PIM)
7. [Helpdesk administrator](/azure/active-directory/roles/permissions-reference#helpdesk-administrator)—can reset passwords for non-administrators and Help Desk administrators
8. [Privileged authentication administrator](/azure/active-directory/roles/permissions-reference#privileged-authentication-administrator)—can access view, set, and reset authentication method information for any user (admin or non-admin)

For relationships that have been transitioned from DAP to GDAP, we'll proceed to remove the corresponding DAP relationships 30 days later. However, we'll pause the transition for the month of June 2023 to support the Microsoft fiscal year closure.

Take note that if a partner has a GDAP relationship with a specific customer, Microsoft won't transition that customer's DAP to GDAP. Microsoft will disable the customer's DAP by the end of July.

#### Graph GDAP API v1.0: App-only

We're actively working towards enabling Graph GDAP API v1.0 with app-only support in April.

#### Now available: Customer and Transact APIs

The [Customer APIs and Transact APIs](../developer/dap-api-impact.md) are now available for DAP-to-GDAP transition.

#### Reminders

We'd also like to remind partners of these previously announced updates and partner actions:

* **Exchange Online automation deprecation**—Exchange Online automation will be deprecated on March 31, 2023. Any code that incorporates either the legacy Exchange Online public client ID (app ID a0c73c16-a7e3-4564-9a95-2bdf47383716) or the Partner Center PowerShell module will cease to function on March 31, 2023. We recommend that partners immediately review code or automation to locate any use of this legacy public client ID. You can find sample scripts in our [Partner Center documentation](/powershell/partnercenter/exchange-online-gdap-app?view=partnercenterps-3.0&preserve-view=true). You'll find additional details regarding this change in the [January Security monthly update](./2023-january.md#exchange-online-automation-affecting-change-on-march-31-2023).
* **Update your security contact**—You should add a security contact to receive Azure fraud notification emails. Learn more about [handling Azure fraud notifications](../azure-fraud-notification.md#what-to-do-when-you-receive-a-security-alert-notification). We recommend investigating and [updating the fraud event status](../developer/update-fraud-events-status.md).
* **Bulk migration tool**—This tool has been enhanced to allow partners to remove DAP relationships in bulk. It also allows you to carry out bulk editing, deletion of access assignments, and deletion of GDAP relationships. For more details, review the [GDAP bulk migration tool resource in Partner Center](../gdap-bulk-migration-tool.md).
* **Azure fraud alerts**—On January 9, 2023, Microsoft enhanced the capabilities of detecting and notifying Azure fraud alerts. Partners can register a new webhook, azure-fraud-event-detected, in [Partner Center webhook events](../developer/partner-center-webhook-events.md). Additional details regarding this change can be found in the [January Security monthly update](./2023-january.md#available-now).

### Next steps

   * Sign up for a [live webinar](https://vshow.on24.com/vshow/Security_Depth/registration/22777).
3. Review the [Partner Center security requirements](../partner-security-requirements.md) and [the CSP security best practices](../csp-security-best-practices.md).
4. Sign up for dedicated [CSP Security Q&A](https://globalpbocomm.eventbuilder.com/GranularDelegatedAdminPrivilegesinCSPQASession) sessions to have your queries answered by subject matter experts.
5. Review the new [journey map](https://partner.microsoft.com/resources/detail/securing-the-channel-journey-to-zero-trust-pdf) to navigate the transformational journey for partners to Zero Trust. It provides milestones, resources, and actions to take as we continue through this transformation.

## <a name="3"></a> New secondary deal review upload feature

Date: March 1, 2023

### Summary

A feature to support our partners in submitting and managing secondary deal review documents will be expanded globally (excluding USA) in Partner Center.

### Workspace

Help + support

### Impacted audience

Cloud Solution Provider (CSP) direct partners or indirect providers with customers globally (excluding USA)

### Details

Microsoft runs on trust. We're committed to providing a compliant, safe, and secure method of transacting customer subscriptions in the CSP program. The secondary review desk aligns with Microsoft's ethical selling practices, builds trust, and is critical for your success.

Beginning March 1, Microsoft expanded **the capability for partners to test within their sandbox environment** an update that allows CSP partners to upload requested end-customer purchase commitment details related to their purchase order (PO). This new feature gives partners the ability to enter and verify specific information, attach relevant documents related to the end customer purchase commitment, and track the overall status of the order that's under secondary review directly in Partner Center. This feature will go live June 1, 2023.

For more information on the secondary review process, what to upload for the end customer purchase commitment, or the information required in this form, view the training at the [Secondary Review Desk Collection](https://partner.microsoft.com/resources/collection/secondary-review-desk-collection#/).

Remember that a deal being flagged for review doesn't necessarily mean that there are any inherent issues present, but rather, a combination of multiple risk attributes required Microsoft to take a deeper look.

#### Partner impact

A new set of order states will be introduced when transactions are required to provide additional documentation.

Orders can now be in the following states:

- **Pending PO upload:** This means that you're required to select the link to upload documentation for a secondary deal review. Follow the link on the upload documentation page for more information.
- **PO upload submitted:** Thank you! This status means that you've uploaded the required documentation for secondary review, and this order is currently being reviewed.
- **Approved:** This means that the secondary review has been completed and this order is now being processed.
- **Rejected:** This status means that this order didn't pass the secondary review and won't be processed.

#### Technical information for testing the PO upload

- [Attaching a purchase order and completing purchase order details](/partner-center/develop/attaching-purchase-order-and-completing-po-details)

You can find the steps for uploading the document in the [Secondary deal review training deck](https://partner.microsoft.com/resources/detail/secondary-review-overview-pdf).

### Next Steps

- When testing with your sandbox tenant ID, use one or both of the following products so that we can distinguish the test from your other test transactions:

    - *SKU title:* Access LTSC 2021
    - *Product type:* Perpetual software
