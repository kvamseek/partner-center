## New UI to manage Azure Spending with improved performance coming to New Commerce Experience

We’re thrilled to announce the release of our new Azure Spending (beta) UI page, designed to offer improved performance and better user experience for our partners.

With this new experience, partners can now easily view, set, edit, or remove monthly Azure budgets for customers with Azure plan subscriptions. The Azure Spending (beta) page provides a streamlined experience with enhanced functionality, making it easier than ever for our partners to manage their Azure spending. 

#### Details

One of the key features of the new **Azure Spending (beta)** page is its improved performance. We’ve worked hard to make sure that our partners can quickly and efficiently access usage data and insights through the new experience. With this new version of the page, we’re confident that you’ll be able to better manage your Azure budgets and make informed decisions about your customers’ spending.

We’re excited to offer this new experience to our partners and look forward to receiving feedback as we continue to improve and enhance this experience in the coming months.
