## Discontinuation notice: Nonprofit customer change to Microsoft 365 E2 grant

*Microsoft is communicating to web direct customers, who may also be CSP customers, about the legacy E2 grant. Effective October 1, 2023, customers will no longer be able to renew the legacy office 365 E2 grant offer.*

- **Date**: April 10, 2023
- **Workspace**: Customers
- **Impacted audience**: Cloud Solution Provider (CSP) direct partners, indirect resellers and indirect providers with nonprofit customers using the Office 365 E2 Grant via a Web direct subscription.

Microsoft is communicating to web direct customer Admins about their use of the legacy Office 365 E2. Some of these customers will also be using CSP with partners and utilizing the grant and discounted licenses. We want partners to be aware of what we are communicating to customers and be ready to assist customers should they need to discuss options.
