## CSP customers to be notified of MCA acceptance

*From April 15, CSP customers will receive a notification of their acceptance of the Microsoft Customer Agreement (MCA) through their transacting partner.*

- **Date**: April 5, 2023
- **Workspace**: Customers
- **Impacted audience**: Cloud Solution Provider (CSP) direct bill partners, indirect providers, and indirect resellers through their indirect providers, as well as control panel vendors

As of April 15, when a partner attests to a customer’s acceptance of the MCA, the customer will receive an email notification from Microsoft informing them of the partner’s attestation.

The objective of this email communication is to ensure the customer knows they've accepted the MCA and to refer the customer to their transacting partner if they have questions.

#### Next steps

- Share this information with the appropriate stakeholders in your organization.
- Be prepared to provide evidence of the agreement acceptance to your customer upon request.
- For indirect providers: If your customer purchased from an indirect reseller in your channel, it’s important to educate the reseller about the agreement and the customer acceptance requirement.
