## Microsoft to manage end-customer taxation (GST) for enterprise agreement commercial marketplace sales in Australia

*Starting June 1, 2023, Microsoft will manage end-customer taxation (GST) for Australia EA customers buying ISV products through the commercial marketplace.*

- **Date:** April 28, 2023
- **Workspace:** Billing
- **Impacted audience:** All independent software vendors (ISVs) selling to Australian enterprise agreement (EA) customers via the commercial marketplace

ISVs selling via the commercial marketplace to Australian EA customers will no longer need to manage (calculate, collect, and remit) end-customer taxation.

This change won't add costs to ISVs. Instead, it will simplify their processes and bring tax management consistency to the commercial marketplace across all end-customer channels.

There are no changes to the reseller Cloud Solution Provider program because it remains Microsoft tax-managed. This update is another investment to streamline procurement for customers and partners and ensure a premium digital B2B marketplace experience.

#### Next steps

- Share this communication with the appropriate stakeholders in your organization.
- Confirm that your marketplace offers are available to Australian customers by selecting Australia in the **Markets** section of **Pricing availability** in the [**Marketplace** workspace in Partner Center](https://partner.microsoft.com/dashboard/commercial-marketplace/offers).
- Learn how to publish your solution on the commercial marketplace by visiting our [live and on-demand marketplace Office Hours](https://microsoftcloudpartner.eventbuilder.com/MarketplaceOverviewandQAforPartners).
- Review the [billing and invoicing for Azure Marketplace customers](/marketplace/billing-invoicing) documentation and share it with your customers. Inform them that the invoice format will change on June 1, 2023.
- Review [how tax policies affect payout for Azure Marketplace](../../../tax-policies-affect-payout.md).
- On June 1, the [tax details for the Microsoft commercial marketplace](../../../tax-details-marketplace.md) documentation will be updated.

> [!NOTE]
> The go-live availability date is subject to change.
