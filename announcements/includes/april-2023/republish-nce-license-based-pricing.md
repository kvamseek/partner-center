## Republish of NCE license-based pricing for European markets during April 2023

*There's a republished price list for partners in European markets.*

- **Date**: April 12, 2023
- **Workspace**: Pricing
- **Impacted audience**: Cloud Solution Provider (CSP) direct-bill partners and indirect providers who use new commerce experience license-based pricing for European markets.

On April 12, 2023, the new commerce experience (NCE) current month license-based price list for European markets was republished. Partners who resell in these markets should download the April 2023 updated price list, for their applicable markets, to have the latest data.

A pricing correction to Microsoft 365 E3 and E5 offers was identified which impacts European markets. Partners will notice a price change for the following Microsoft 365 E5 products. Other products' prices are unaffected, and the future month price list is unaffected.

| Product title                                | Product ID   | Product SKU |
|----------------------------------------------|--------------|-------------|
| Microsoft 365 E5                             | CFQ7TTC0LFLZ | 0002        |
| Microsoft 365 E5 without Audio Conferencing  | CFQ7TTC0LFLZ | 0003        |
| Microsoft 365 E3                             | CFQ7TTC0LFLX | 0001        |
| Microsoft 365 E3 - Unattended License        | CFQ7TTC0LFLX | 0003        |

> [!NOTE]
> Republishing may cause products to appear twice in the price list. Where this occurs, filter by the most recent Effective Start Date to see the most recent data.
> For purchases made between April 1, 2023 and April 12, 2023, Microsoft will work to correct any overcharges due to pricing adjustments.
