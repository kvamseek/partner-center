### From the office or home to the frontline with Windows 365 Cloud PCs

The Windows 365 service continues to evolve with new offerings such as Windows 365 Frontline, now in public preview. Customers are already finding value with this increased flexibility to meet the needs of shift workers. Windows 365 helps provide a secure, reliable Windows experience, whether employees or network guests are desk-based, mobile, or even share physical PCs or kiosks.

The recent announcements and PR campaign are anchored with a blog post written by our Modern Work Apps and Endpoints General Manager Wangui McKelvey, "Windows 365 offers flexibility from the office or home to the frontline." This is illustrated with example scenarios in healthcare, call centers, construction, and retail, among others.
