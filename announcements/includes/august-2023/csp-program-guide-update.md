## A Cloud Solution Provider (CSP) Program Guide update is coming

*The guide to the Online Services and Software Channel Authorization (CSP Program Guide) will be updated, effective October 12, 2023.*

- **Date**: August 17, 2023
- **Workspace**: General
- **Impacted audience**: Direct bill partners, indirect providers, and indirect resellers transacting through the CSP program

The CSP Program Guide contains the terms and conditions governing commercial marketplace offers between Microsoft and partners in the CSP program.

In the updated CSP Program Guide, the following regions move into the United States regions and market list:

- American Samoa (from the list of Australia regions and markets)

The transacting currency for these regions will also be changed to USD.

The updated CSP Program Guide will go into effect automatically on October 12, 2023, without any other action required from partners. Partners should review the updated CSP Program Guide to ensure they're operating in compliance with the CSP program.
