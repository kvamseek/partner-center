## Partner Center will display in a light or dark theme based on your browser settings

*On August 21, 2023, Partner Center will use your local browser's settings to determine whether to display in a light or dark theme.*

- **Date:** August 8, 2023
- **Workspace:** General
- **Impacted audience:** All Partner Center users

In Partner Center, Dark Mode will no longer be an option in the Settings menu. Partner Center will use your browser settings to determine whether to display pages in a light or dark theme. Dark themes are often easier on the eyes in low-light environments.

#### Next steps

Here's how to change the theme between light and dark modes in different browsers:

- [Google Chrome](https://support.google.com/chrome/answer/9275525?hl=en&co=GENIE.Platform%3DDesktop)
- [Mozilla Firefox](https://support.mozilla.org/en-US/kb/use-themes-change-look-of-firefox)
