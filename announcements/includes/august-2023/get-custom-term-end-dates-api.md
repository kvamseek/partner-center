## The Get Custom Term End Dates API is now available for partners

_A new API is now generally available to Microsoft Partners._

- **Date**: August 11, 2023
- **Workspace**: Customers
- **Impacted audience**: Direct bill partners and indirect providers transacting through the Cloud Solution Provider (CSP) program

Partners can use a new API to view allowed custom term end dates for NCE license-based subscriptions they're purchasing for their customers. The API response enables partners to identify subscription end dates that align with the end of the calendar month or that co-term with existing customer subscriptions. To learn more about the API, see [Get Custom Term End Dates API](../../../developer/custom-term-end-dates.md).
