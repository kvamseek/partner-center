## Manage Azure Spending for new commerce only on the Azure Spending (NCE) page

_We'd like to inform our partners that effective August 15, 2023, the **Azure Plan** tab will retire from the **Azure spending** page to manage Azure budgets. Partners will be able to manage Azure budgets for new commerce or Azure plan in the new **Azure spending (NCE)** page. However, partners have the ability to continue managing legacy Azure budgets for customers on the **Azure spending** page._

- **Date**: August 14, 2023
- **Workspace**: Billing
- **Impacted audience**: Global partners who have customers with Azure plan subscriptions.

This change is part of our ongoing effort to improve the user experience and provide a more streamlined process for managing Azure budgets. The new Azure Spending (NCE) page offers a more intuitive interface and more features to help partners better manage their Azure budgets.

We encourage our partners to familiarize themselves with the new Azure spending (NCE) page and take advantage of enhanced functionality and improved user experience.  

To access the new Azure Spending page, sign into [Partner Center](https://partner.microsoft.com/dashboard/home) and go to the Azure spending (NCE) task menu on the left-hand side. To learn more, see [Set an Azure spending budget for customers - Partner Center](../../../set-an-azure-spending-budget-for-your-customers.md). 

Thank you for your continued partnership with us. For more information, see the [announcement](../../2023-april.md#new-ui-to-manage-azure-spending-with-improved-performance-coming-to-new-commerce-experience) made when the new Azure Spending (NCE) page was launched.
