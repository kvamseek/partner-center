## New report shows capability-based co-selling insights on services co-selling

_We've introduced a new feature in the **Co-sell insights** page that helps Microsoft Partners analyze their services co-selling performance and track the lifecycle of services co-sell deals._

- **Date**: August 28, 2023
- **Workspace**: Insights
- **Impacted audience**: Services Partners who have Microsoft AI Cloud Partner Program designations such as Azure Expert MSP, Specializations or Solutions Partner designations.

Now, on the **Co-sell** page in the **Referral Insights** workspace, you can see a new report that shows services co-selling related insights for co-sell eligible Services partners who are either:

- Microsoft AI Cloud Partner Program designations, such as Azure Expert MSP or
- Are endorsed by the business teams to provide Deployment services.

The report now displays metrics for IP co-sell and Services co-sell referrals in different tabs. To see both types of referrals together, select the **All** tab.

In addition, a new Capabilities widget has been introduced dedicated to displaying services co-sell deals with two pivots: **Partner role** and **Partner program**.
