## Enhancements to customer matching in new deal creation flow

_When creating a new deal, we now show more Microsoft accounts as suggestions for account matching to speed up the responses by Microsoft Sellers._

- **Date**: August 28, 2023
- **Workspace**: Referrals
- **Impacted audience**: Referral admins

Customer account matching while creating new co-sell opportunities has a few enhancements:

- We now additionally match accounts with Microsoft account IDs.
- We now prompt users with suggested accounts more explicitly in the user interface.

Partners are encouraged to choose Microsoft recommended accounts to avoid the delays associated with an internal account matching process. Also, the process of assigning referrals to Microsoft Sellers will be faster if an account selected in the system is used.
