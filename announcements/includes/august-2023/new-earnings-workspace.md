## Introducing Earnings workspace in Partner Center

_The Payouts workspace will be replaced by a new Earnings workspace in September 2023. The new workspace features a new look and feel with improved page usability and faster downloads, and a customer-centric view of revenue, usage, earnings and payments._

- **Date**: August 23, 2023
- **Workspace**: Earnings
- **Impacted audience**: All partners who use Partner Center to view earnings and payouts, such as Incentive Admin and Incentive Users

Partners will be able to make informed decisions by identifying opportunities and risks across their customers to increase earnings and get actionable customer recommendations for proactive customer lifecycle management.

This change includes the following benefits:

- Fresh look and feel, improved page usability, and faster downloads
- Customer-centric earnings and revenue insights on the user interface
- Ability to search by customer name
- Ability to instantly download user interface views

> [!NOTE]
