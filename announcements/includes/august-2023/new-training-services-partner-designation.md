## Monthly Update: What's new for Solutions Partner designations, Specializations, and other program benefits

_Important capabilities, offers and updates have been introduced to improve the way partners can further differentiate their deep technical expertise across a set of priority scenarios with high customer demand._

- **Date**: August 15, 2023
- **Workspace**: Membership
- **Impacted audience**: Partners enrolled in the Microsoft AI Cloud Partner Program

#### New Training Services Partner designation

In September 2023, we're announcing the launch of our new Training Services Partner designation, formerly known as the Learning Partner Program. Partners enrolled in the AI Cloud Partner Program will be able to access the Training Services partner performance reports in Partner Center. The full availability of this program, along with access to program benefits, is scheduled for early 2024.

#### New Partner Support Services designation

On July 18, 2023, Microsoft provided an update regarding plans to launch a Partner Support Services designation, which builds on the solution area designations and further recognizes a partner's breadth and excellence of support capabilities. The designation is expected to launch in the latter half of 2024.

In the meantime, we are opening a limited public preview for partners to get an early look at the designation and get on the fast track to qualifying when the program is fully available. Learn more about the criteria for joining the public preview and [nominate yourself with this simple form](https://forms.office.com/r/0b43qte1dj).

#### Reminders

- Last month we launched three new specializations to the Business Applications, Digital and App Innovation, and Data and AI solution areas. Learn about these three new options [on the Partner blog.](https://blogs.partner.microsoft.com/partner/introducing-three-new-specializations-for-azure-and-business-applications/)

- We renamed a specialization currently in market. Modernization of Web Applications with Microsoft Azure is now **Migrate Enterprise Applications to Microsoft Azure** effective July 11, 2023. Partners who have earned this specialization can download the new badge called **Migrate Enterprise Applications to Microsoft Azure** by signing up in [Partner Center](https://partner.microsoft.com/).

- Legacy benefits are still available to partners who held a legacy competency on September 30, 2022. If your legacy benefits expired since October 2022 and you do not have an active benefit kit through a **Solutions Partner** designation, check [Partner Center offers](https://partner.microsoft.com/dashboard/v2/membership/offers) to see if you are eligible to renew your legacy benefits.
