## Republish of deprecated (DEPR) products on legacy license-based price list (AUD, CAD, CHF) and price list preview (NZD)

*There's a republished price list (AUD, CAD, CHF) and price list preview (NZD) for legacy license-based products.*

- **Date**: August 17, 2023
- **Workspace**: Pricing
- **Impacted audience**: Cloud Solution Provider (CSP), direct-bill partners and indirect providers who use legacy license-based pricing in AUD, CAD, CHF, and NZD

As you may already know, the deprecated (DEPR) products represent legacy blocked offers. These are no longer available for new purchase, but existing customer subscriptions aren't impacted (that is, renewals are still working). Microsoft Partners canâ€™t purchase these.

The price list that was published on August 1, 2023, for the Australian dollars (AUD), Canadian dollars (CAD), and Swiss francs (CHF) currencies has the September 1, 2023, DEPR product pricing. To remedy this, we're promptly republishing the price list today with the correct prices.

The price list preview that was published on August 1 for New Zealand dollars (NZD) for DEPR products doesn't have the new September 1 pricing. We're republishing the price list preview today with the correct prices.

#### Next steps

- If impacted, download the new price list or price list preview.
