## Microsoft Teams Audio Conferencing transition now available for NCE

*Through December 31, 2023, we're offering the exclusive possibility to transition from the $2.50 Audio Conferencing offer to the $0.00 Audio Conferencing offer.*

- **Date**: August 29, 2023
- **Workspace**: General
- **Impacted audience**: All CSP partners

In 2022, we introduced two Audio Conferencing SKUs via the new commerce experience (NCE):

- Audio Conferencing with [Zone A countries and regions](/microsoftteams/audio-conferencing-zones#zone-a-countries-and-regions) dial out minutes. Product ID: CFQ7TTC0LHSL priced at $2.50
- Audio Conferencing with US & CA dial out minutes. Product ID: CFQ7TTC0JXCZ priced at $0.00

For a limited time, we offered a 12-month discount on the Audio Conferencing SKU with Zone A country/region dial out minutes. This might have caused confusion.

We're now offering the exclusive possibility to transition from the $2.50 Audio Conferencing offer to the $0.00 Audio Conferencing offer. This transition path will be available from August 23, 2023, to December 31, 2023, only.

#### Next steps

- If your customer has been using the Audio Conferencing SKU (Product ID: CFQ7TTC0LHSL) with the expiring/expired promotional price, work with them to determine which Audio Conferencing SKU best meets their needs based on the countries or regions they need to dial out to.
- For misaligned subscriptions, move your customers to the $0 add-on SKU (Product ID: CFQ7TTC0JXCZ), using the transition path mentioned here.

#### Questions?

- For issues or other concerns with this process, partners can file a [support request](https://partner.microsoft.com/support/?stage=1) on a case-by-case basis. The timeline to submit a support request for this matter will be open until December 31, 2023.
