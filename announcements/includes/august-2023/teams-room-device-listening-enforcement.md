## Microsoft Teams Rooms Licensing Enforcement starting October 1, 2023

_In 30 days, Microsoft Teams Rooms Licensing Policy will enforce mandatory Teams Rooms licenses starting October 1, 2023._

- **Date**: August 30, 2023
- **Workspace**: Customers and Partners
- **Impacted audience**: Cloud Solution Provider (CSP) and Licensing Solution Provider (LSP) partners

As of October 1, 2023, Teams Rooms devices, including those using Personal Mode, and the Teams application on Surface Hub and Teams Panels, will be **blocked** from signing in without a valid Teams Rooms license. To prevent imminent service disruption, work with your customers to provision and activate either a Teams Rooms Pro ($40) or Teams Rooms Basic ($0 / max 25 devices), Teams Rooms Premium, Teams Rooms Standard license, or Teams Rooms Shared Device License (panels only) **before** the deadline.

For Teams Panels, customers need to provision a Teams Shared Device license for accounts where a Teams Panel is deployed to a space where there's no Teams Room or Surface Hub in the room. The policy also includes devices enrolled in the Pro Management portal. A Teams Rooms Pro or Teams Rooms Premium license will be required to take advantage of the AI-powered cross-platform device management capabilities of the Pro Management portal.

#### Next steps

Your customers have 30 days to act! Work with your customers NOW to avoid service disruption on October 1, 2023 when this change takes effect.
