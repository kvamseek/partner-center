## ISV partners can now create private offers for SaaS and VM products with customized attributes

*Independent software vendor (ISV) partners are now able to create private offers for their SaaS and VM software reservation products with customized attributes.*

- **Date:** July 13, 2023
- **Workspace:** Marketplace offers
- **Impacted audience:** ISV partners

Previously, ISVs could only provide discounted pricing to their customers as part of the private offers capability and with the other attributes remaining the same as those of the publicly listed plan. With this launch, you'll now be able to create private offers to sell your software-as-a-service (SaaS) and virtual machine (VM) products by customizing:

- Quantities for SaaS custom meters and SaaS seat count
- Quantities, price, term duration, and billing frequency for VM software reservations

This capability to create SaaS and VM software reservation private offers with customized attributes is also supported within multiparty private offers.

#### Next steps

Ensure that, as an ISV partner, your solutions are transactional on the marketplace, that you can understand and use current private offer capability, and have built relationships with customers to provide them with customized private offers for SaaS and VMs.

Review the resources about this article and share with the appropriate stakeholders in your organization. To create a custom private offer, refer to [Configure ISV to customer private offers](../../../marketplace/isv-customer.md).
