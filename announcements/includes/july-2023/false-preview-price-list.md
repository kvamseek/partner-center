## NCE license-based preview price list will display false positives in countries/regions where there are no FX changes

*In August, partners may see false positives on the NCE license-based price list preview for countries or regions not impacted by the FX rate changes.*

- **Date:** July 31, 2023
- **Workspace:** Pricing
- **Impacted audience:** Cloud Solution Provider partners (indirect providers and direct bill) in all markets/countries/regions

As expected, beginning August 1, 2023, the August NCE license-based preview for Australian dollars (AUD), New Zealand dollars (NZD), Canadian dollars (CAD), and Swiss francs (CHF) will show the products that will change price in September due to the FX rate change. However, the same products will also show (as false positives) on the price list preview of the countries or regions that aren't impacted by the FX rate changes.

#### Next steps
