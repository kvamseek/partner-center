As enterprises choose hybrid and multicloud environments as part of their IT strategy, they struggle to control and govern increasingly complex environments that use different sets of tools and technologies. Azure Arc-enabled SQL Server simplifies governance and management by using a single point of control to extend Azure services to SQL Server instances hosted outside of Azure. These services may be in on-premises data centers, in edge site locations like retail stores, or on any public cloud or hosting provider.

The sessions will address these topics:

- Overview of Azure Arc and Arc-enabled SQL Server
- How to deploy Arc-enabled SQL Server (with demos)
- Features available in Arc-enabled SQL Server (with demos)
- Roadmap

#### Next steps
