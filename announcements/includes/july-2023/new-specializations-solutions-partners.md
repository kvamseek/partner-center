## New specializations for Solutions Partners in the Microsoft AI Cloud Partner Program

*On July 11, 2023, Microsoft added new specializations to the Business Applications, Digital and App Innovation, and Data and AI solution areas.*

- **Date**: July 12, 2023
- **Workspace**: Benefits
- **Impacted audience**: Partners enrolled in the Data and AI, Digital App and Innovation, and Business Applications solution areas

Effective July 11, 2023, we've changed specializations in the Microsoft AI Cloud Partner Program.

##### New specializations

Microsoft has added three new specializations to the Business Applications, Digital and App Innovation, and Data and AI solution areas:

- **Build and Modernize AI Apps with Microsoft Azure**: Showcase your expertise in building intelligent apps across Apps, Data, and AI.
- **Business Intelligence**: Confirm your ability to help customers get the most out of their data and implement enterprise BI solutions with Power BI interactive reports, real-time dashboards, and powerful analytics.
- **Intelligent Automation**: Demonstrate expert capabilities delivering end-to-end business process transformation for customers with Power Automate.

Earning a specialization validates and differentiates partners' expertise in delivering specific services in areas with high customer demand. These new offerings benefit partners in the Microsoft AI Cloud Partner Program with a Solutions Partner designation who can demonstrate deep knowledge and proven success in a specific area.

##### Renamed specialization

Additionally, as a measure to illuminate our services, we've renamed a specialization currently in market. **Modernization of Web Applications with Microsoft Azure** is now **Migrate Enterprise Applications to Microsoft Azure** effective July 11, 2023.

Achieving the new specializations benefits partners by helping to streamline processes with innovative services that simplify the market, build opportunity, and affect recurring revenue streams. Partners who earn a specialization have a customer-facing label displayed on their business profile, gain access to specific go-to-market offerings, and are prioritized in customer searches in the Microsoft AppSource.

#### Next steps

Partners need to check the requirements associated with gaining these specializations and take appropriate actions to qualify.

Partners who have earned the **Modernization of Web Applications with Microsoft Azure** badge can download the new badge called **Migrate Enterprise Applications to Microsoft Azure** by signing up in [Partner Center](https://partner.microsoft.com/aad/authPostGateway) and updating their sales and marketing materials.
