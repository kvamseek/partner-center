## Next steps in CSP new commerce: Commercial legacy seat-based subscription migration and introduction of public sector offers

*In fiscal year 2024, Microsoft is taking two important steps toward the retirement of the CSP legacy commerce platform. Beginning in November 2023, public sector (academic, government community cloud [GCC], not-for-profit [NFP]/charity) offers will be available in new commerce for new and renewing customers. Starting in January 2024, Microsoft will begin automatic migration of all renewing commercial and public sector customers to new commerce.*

- **Date**: July 11, 2023
- **Workspace**: General
- **Impacted audience**: Cloud Solution Provider (CSP) direct bill and indirect resellers; indirect providers

##### CSP commercial legacy subscription migrations

CSP partners have been steadily migrating their commercial legacy customers to new commerce since October 2021. We know that managing customers' business on two platforms is burdensome. Based on partner requests for help, from January 2024, Microsoft will begin migrating commercial legacy seat-based subscriptions to new commerce. All legacy subscriptions that Microsoft migrates to new commerce will be set to an annual term, with the same billing plan and seat counts that the customers had in legacy. The Microsoft-led migration will occur on the date of subscription renewal, starting with all subscriptions renewing in January 2024 and continuing throughout the 2024 calendar year. Partners will have seven days after migration is complete to change the subscription term and/or quantity or cancel the subscription, if necessary.

We recommend that you manage your customers' migrations. If your customers want monthly subscription terms in new commerce instead of annual terms, you should migrate them before the legacy subscriptions reach their end of term in 2024. The benefits of proactively migrating customers' subscriptions include the ability to amend terms and conditions and socialize this change with indirect resellers and others in the partner's ecosystem.

The chart offers a timeline view of the CSP legacy migration plan. Partners can find the list of CSP legacy offers available for new commerce migration in the legacy offer matrix in the [Partner Center Pricing workspace](https://partner.microsoft.com/dashboard/pricing/pricelist). *The list currently displays only legacy commercial offers.* Public sector offers will be added in November 2023 as the details are finalized for their migration to new commerce. Over the course of the 2024 calendar year, Microsoft will share the timeline for migration of all remaining CSP legacy offers. Our intent is to ensure a Microsoft-led migration path for each CSP legacy offer at the time of renewal, starting with renewal dates in 2024 and beyond.

| Legacy offers targeted for new commerce | When partners can begin migrating the legacy offers on their own | When Microsoft will migrate the legacy offers |
| --- | --- | --- |
| Commercial offers (Microsoft 365, Security, Office 365, Dynamics 365) | Now | On the subscription renewal date in 2024, starting with January 2024 renewals |
| Public sector: Education, NFA, GCC| November 2023 | On the subscription renewal date in 2024, starting with January 2024 renewals |
| Multiyear offers (for example, six-year education SKUs) | When the offers are published in the legacy offer matrix | On the subscription renewal date in 2024, 2025, and onward |

##### CSP public sector legacy offers (government, education, and NFP) coming to new commerce in November 2023

Microsoft is pleased to announce that public sector subscriptions, which include academic, GCC, and NFP/charity, will be ready for partners to move to new commerce starting in November 2023. We encourage partners to work with customers on a plan to move their subscriptions to new commerce starting in November to allow them to set the subscription terms that work best for their customers.

As is the case with commercial offers, starting January 2024, Microsoft will begin migrating legacy CSP public sector offers to an annual term in new commerce with the same billing plan and seat counts that the customers had in legacy. CSP partners whose customers want monthly terms in new commerce should migrate those customers' subscriptions with the desired details in place (such as terms and seat counts) before the 2024 renewal date. Otherwise, partners will have seven days after the Microsoft-led migration is complete to change the subscription details or cancel it if necessary. 

In November 2023, the list of CSP public sector legacy offers available for new commerce migration will be reflected in the legacy offer matrix in the [Partner Center Pricing workspace](https://partner.microsoft.com/dashboard/pricing/pricelist).

##### Resources to help manually migrate customers to new commerce

Partners can migrate subscriptions now by referencing the [Migrate subscriptions to new commerce](../../../migrate-subscriptions-to-new-commerce.md) page and following the steps outlined in Partner Center.

To support partners with the migration effort, we'll schedule technical training sessions and CSP Spotlight online webinars in October, November, and December. These learning sessions will give partners a comprehensive view of the details involved in migration. Look for an update in September 2023 featuring a schedule of migration-focused events.
