## Microsoft's commitment to ensuring partner compliance - resending with corrections

*This resent communication aims to notify partners that Microsoft will enhance our approach to remediating compliance failures by our partners.*

- **Date**: July 13, 2023
- **Workspace**: Incentives
- **Impacted audience**: All partners participating in Microsoft incentive programs

This announcement contains corrections to the [July 3, 2023 announcement](../../2023-july.md#2).

At Microsoft, we're committed to our mission of empowering every person and every organization on the planet to achieve more. This mission reflects who we are as an organization and how we approach our customers, partners, governments, and suppliers. We're committed to winning in the market ethically and in compliance with the laws and regulations of the countries/regions in which we operate. Our values are enshrined in our Standards of Business Conduct: respect, integrity, and accountability. As such, we expect our partners to embrace and continually improve on these values. Our expectations and integrity standards and policies are outlined in our [Partner Code of Conduct](https://www.microsoft.com/legal/compliance/anticorruption/trustworthy-representatives#primaryR8) and partner contracts.

We have enhanced our programs to ensure that our partners and suppliers adhere to the compliance requirements set forth in our contracts and Partner Code of Conduct. Part of this approach is to address noncompliant behavior by our partners more effectively. Partners that continue to exhibit compliance violations will be required to participate in Microsoft's Partner Accountability and Remediation program - a multistep program of work designed to improve a partner's compliance capabilities.

Other actions to address persistent noncompliance violations include, but aren't limited to the following:

- Further training
- Pause in future discretionary incentives/investments
- Partner's repayment to Microsoft of incentives earned through noncompliant behavior
- Deauthorization from certain Microsoft partner programs
- Removal of noncompliant partner(s) from Microsoft's partner ecosystem.

To help our partners along their compliance journey, we have also developed and improved our partner compliance training and readiness offerings. This includes direct-to-partner engagement on compliance-related articles, compliance readiness materials, and online training offerings. Contact your Microsoft account representative for more details on how to access these materials. We truly value our partners and are committed to building a relationship built on trust that will ensure we continue to win in the market the right way.

Thanks for your partnership with Microsoft.
