## Microsoft's commitment to ensuring partner compliance

*This communication aims to make partners aware of enhancements to the consequences for partners who violate Microsoft's partner compliance requirements.*

- **Date**: July 3, 2023
- **Workspace**: Incentives
- **Impacted audience**: All partners participating in Microsoft incentive programs

At Microsoft, we're committed to our mission of empowering every person and every organization on the planet to achieve more. This mission reflects who we are as an organization and how we approach our customers, partners, governments, and suppliers. We're committed to winning in the market ethically and in compliance with the laws and regulations of the countries/regions in which we operate. Our values are enshrined in our Standards of Business Conduct: respect, integrity, and accountability. As such, we expect our partners to embrace and continually improve on these values. Our expectations and integrity standards and policies are outlined in our [Partner Code of Conduct](https://www.microsoft.com/legal/compliance/anticorruption/trustworthy-representatives#primaryR8) and partner contracts.

To ensure we can operate in global markets and meet the high standards for compliance set by ourselves and our regulators, we're continuously evolving our risk and compliance posture. Accordingly, we have enhanced our programs to ensure that our partners and suppliers adhere to the compliance requirements set forth in our contracts and Partner Code of Conduct. Part of this approach is to increase penalties for noncompliant behavior by our partners. Partners with repeated instances of noncompliance will be required to participate in Microsoft's Partner Accountability and Remediation program - a multistep program of work designed to improve a partner's compliance capabilities. Partners who enter this program because of multiple infraction occurrences might have their incentives payments withheld until Microsoft determines that they've successfully completed the program. Failure to participate in this program might result in offboarding from Microsoft's partner programs.

Other penalties for compliance violations include but aren't limited to the following:

- Required training
- Loss of incentives
- Partner's repayment to Microsoft of incentives earned through noncompliant behavior

In certain cases, Microsoft might revoke a partner's authorization to sell in certain Microsoft partner programs or remove noncompliant partners from Microsoft's partner ecosystem.

To help our partners along their compliance journey, we have also developed and improved our partner compliance training and readiness offerings. This includes direct-to-partner engagement on compliance-related topics, compliance readiness materials, and online training offerings. Contact your Microsoft account representative for more details on how to access these materials. We truly value our partners and are committed to building a relationship built on trust that will ensure we continue to win in the market the right way.

Thanks for your partnership with Microsoft.
