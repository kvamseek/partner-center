## Immediate action required for Microsoft Teams Rooms licensing enforcement

*Beginning July 1, the Microsoft Teams Rooms licensing policy enforces mandatory Teams Rooms licenses.*

- **Date:** July 1, 2023
- **Workspace**: Customers
- **Impacted audience**: Cloud Solution Provider (CSP) and Licensing Solution Provider (LSP) partners

As [previously communicated](../../2023-june.md#6), Teams Rooms devices, including those using Personal Mode and the Teams application on Surface Hub and Teams Panels are **blocked** from signing in without a valid Teams Rooms license. To prevent imminent service disruption, work with your customers to provision and activate either a **Teams Rooms Pro** ($40), **Teams Rooms Basic** ($0 / max 25 devices), **Teams Rooms Premium**, **Teams Rooms Standard**, or **Teams Rooms Shared Device** license (panels only) before the deadline.

For Teams Panels, customers need to provision a **Teams Shared Device** license for those accounts where a Teams Panel is deployed to a space where there's no Teams Room or Surface Hub in the room. Also, from July 1, 2023, access to the Teams Rooms Pro Management Portal will be restricted to those customers holding an active **Teams Rooms Pro** or a legacy **Teams Rooms Premium** license.  

#### Next steps

Time is running out! Work with your customers to ensure to avoid service disruption.
