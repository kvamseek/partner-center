- **Impacted audience**: Cloud Solution Provider (CSP) direct-bill partners and indirect providers who use new commerce experience license-based pricing for all markets.

On June 2, 2023, the new commerce experience (NCE) current month license-based price list was republished for all markets. Partners should download the June 2023 updated price list for their applicable markets, to have the latest data.

> [!NOTE]
> Republishing may cause products to appear twice in the price list. Where this occurs, filter by the **Effective End Date** with year ‘9999’ to see the most recent data. For purchases made between June 1, 2023 to June 2, 2023, Microsoft will work to correct any overcharges due to pricing adjustments.

#### Next steps

Partners should cancel any order placed on June 1st at the incorrect price and then repurchase the product at the corrected price.

If your organization resells as part of the CSP program, download the latest NCE license-based pricing sheet for the current month (June 2023).

If there's an impact to your organization, share this information with the appropriate contacts in your company.
