## License-based legacy commercial offers to be deprecated July 2023

*Multiple legacy offers are going to deprecate as of July 1, 2023.*

- **Date**: June 23, 2023
- **Workspace**: Pricing
- **Impacted audience**: Cloud Solution Provider (CSP) direct-bill partners and indirect providers who use legacy license-based pricing and offers for all markets

Some commercial license-based legacy offers that exist in New Commerce will no longer be purchasable as legacy subscriptions.

CSP Partner Center has enabled over 400 legacy license-based offers as migratable to New Commerce. Partners who want **new subscriptions** for any offer that is migratable to New Commerce product SKUs should acquire the New Commerce product SKUs.

Most of the migration-enabled offers available March 2022 were removed at that time, but some offers took longer to deprecate. These offers are being deprecated on July 1, 2023.

Partners will notice 138 legacy license-based commercial offers that are both migratable and available in New Commerce are no longer purchasable in the catalog as **new subscriptions**. Partners that already have customer subscriptions for these deprecated offers aren't impacted and can keep those subscriptions until the end of their terms. Existing subscriptions for these DEPR offers will continue to renew. DEPR only limits new subscriptions to be acquired from the catalog.

Partners can identify the respective New Commerce product SKUs for each of the legacy offers migrate to the **NCE Mapping tab** in the legacy Offer List Matrix. Partners can view deprecated offers in the legacy license-based price list as DEPR (deprecated). These recent deprecated offers will have the **Valid-From Date** value as 20230701 in the July price list available on July 1.

CSP price lists are updated on the first of every month and available from the Partner Center [Pricing workspace](https://partner.microsoft.com/dashboard/pricing/pricelist). The pricing workspace is the place for partners to find the latest price lists and offer matrix files for both license-based and New Commerce license-based offers and product SKUs
