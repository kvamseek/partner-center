## New UI to manage Azure Spending with improved performance for New Commerce Experience

_We’re excited to announce the general availability of the new Azure Spending UI page, designed to offer improved performance and better user experience for our partners. With this new experience, partners can now easily view and manage monthly Azure budgets for customers with Azure plan subscriptions. The Azure Spending page provides a streamlined experience with enhanced functionality, making it easier than ever for our partners to manage their customers’ Azure spending._

- **Date**: June 22, 2023
- **Workspace**: Billing
- **Impacted audience**: All global partners who have customers with Azure plan subscriptions.

One of the key features of the new Azure Spending page is its improved performance. We’ve worked hard to make sure that our partners can quickly and efficiently access usage data and insights through the new experience. Partners can also set up alerts and actions to control costs and avoid overspending. With this new page, we're confident that partners will be able to better manage your customers’ Azure budgets and make informed decisions about their spending. We're committed to providing the best possible experience for our partners, and we look forward to seeing how this new feature enhances your efficiency.

To access the new Azure Spending page, sign into [Partner Center](https://partner.microsoft.com/dashboard/home) and go to the Azure spending (NCE) task menu on the left-hand side. To learn more, see [Set an Azure spending budget for customers](../../../set-an-azure-spending-budget-for-your-customers.md).

> [!NOTE]
> Both the new and old pages enable partners to view and manage their customers’ Azure budgets. However, likely by the end of July, the old page will only support viewing and managing budgets for legacy CSP, while the new page will offer the same for New Commerce. The estimates on these pages may be 24 hours behind the actual usage cost.

#### Benefits

The new page offers the following advantages:

- The new page loads nearly four times faster than the current page.
- It helps you more easily set or update different budget amounts for multiple customers simultaneously.

#### Known limitations

1. Sign in to [Partner Center](https://partner.microsoft.com/dashboard/home) and navigate to the **Billing** workspace.
1. Select the **Azure spending (NCE)** from the task menu on the left-hand side.
