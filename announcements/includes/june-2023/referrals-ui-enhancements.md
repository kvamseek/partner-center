## Referrals UI navigation enhancements

*We've updated some features of the **Referrals** workspace: you can now see more rows at once in the **Co-sell opportunities** grid view and navigate more easily within the **Deal details** page.*

- **Date**: June 19, 2023
- **Workspace**: Referrals
- **Impacted audience**: Referral admins 

We have added two new enhancements to the **Referrals** workspace. 

- First, you can now see more rows in the same page in the **Co-sell opportunities** grid view. Many of our partners had asked us for this functionality to review more deals at a time instead of navigating pages.
- Second, we have added a convenient way to navigate within the **Deal details** page using the **Previous** and **Next** buttons deals without coming back to the grid view. 

> [!NOTE]
> The new view of the **Deal details** page in the **Co-sell opportunities** tab is now permanent, and there will no longer be an option to toggle to the old view.

#### Next steps

- Be sure to try out these features, and let us know your feedback!
