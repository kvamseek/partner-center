## Important update regarding Microsoft Teams Rooms licensing policy enforcement date

*Microsoft Teams Rooms Licensing Policy Enforcement date extended to September 30, 2023.*

- **Date:** June 26, 2023
- **Workspace**: Customers
- **Impacted audience**: Cloud Solution Provider (CSP) and Licensing Solution Provider (LSP) partners

We have an important policy enforcement notice update regarding the licensing for Microsoft Teams Rooms.

[As previously communicated](../../2023-june.md#6), Teams Rooms devices, including those using Personal Mode as well as the Teams application on Surface Hub and Teams Panels will be blocked from signing in without a valid Teams Rooms license starting July 1, 2023.

While we remain steadfast in our objective of ensuring a secure and compliant use of Microsoft Teams Rooms devices, we also acknowledge the need for adequate time to address migration issues. Therefore, we're granting more time to allow you to help your customers complete their transitions smoothly.

To ensure a seamless transition for our partners and customers, Microsoft has decided to provide a 90-day grace period on the Microsoft Teams Rooms Licensing Enforcement. The grace period will begin on July 1, 2023, and end on September 30, 2023.

#### Next steps

If you haven't yet, please use this 90-day grace period to engage with your customers to facilitate the license transition process and address any concerns.  Thank you for your unwavering commitment and support.
