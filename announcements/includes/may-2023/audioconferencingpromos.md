## Microsoft Teams Audio Conferencing promo discount expiration

*With the expiration of the 12-months free Audio Conferencing promotion, learn how to guide your customers to the right Audio Conferencing SKU.*

- **Date**: May 25, 2023
- **Workspace**: Customers
- **Impacted audience**: CSP direct-bill and indirect providers in the Cloud Solution Provider (CSP) program

Starting October 2020, a promotion that enables free Audio Conferencing for 12 months has been available to CSP Partners. This promotion ended June 2022. At the end of the 12 months, Partners who purchased this Audio Conferencing SKU (Product ID: CFQ7TTC0LHSL) will find their subscriptions renewing at the nonpromotional price of $2.50 USD per-user per-month.

Partners may purchase a supplemental $0 add-on SKU (Product ID: CFQ7TTC0JXCZ), which enables Audio Conferencing with unlimited toll dial-in minutes, 60 dial-out minutes per-user/month to United States and Canada phone numbers pooled at the tenant level regardless of tenant location, and Operator Connect Conferencing. **Partners who wish to take advantage of the Audio Conferencing $0 add-on SKU will need to purchase the new SKU.**

Despite the availability of the $0 add-on SKU, customers may choose to continue using their existing Audio Conferencing SKU at the nonpromotional price as the subscription includes unlimited toll dial-in minutes, 60 dial-out minutes per-user/month pooled at the tenant level to [Zone A countries/regions](/microsoftteams/audio-conferencing-zones#zone-a-countries-and-regions), and Operator Connect Conferencing. **Partners who need dial-out beyond the United States and Canada should consider staying with their original Audio Conferencing SKU.**

#### Next steps

- Consult the Partner Center price lists for current pricing for product SKUs.
- If your customer has been using the Audio Conferencing SKU (Product ID: CFQ7TTC0LHSL) with the expiring promotional price, work with them to determine which Audio Conferencing SKU best meets their needs.
- Partners who wish to purchase the new $0 add-on SKU (Product ID: CFQ7TTC0JXCZ), should also ensure that autorenewal isn't enabled for their existing Audio Conferencing SKU. 
- Ensure user licenses are assigned for any newly purchased SKU.
