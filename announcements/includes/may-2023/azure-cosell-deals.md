## Important updates for Azure IP co-sell deals in the commercial marketplace registered in Q4

*In an effort to streamline FY2023 Q4 marketplace deal processing, all marketplace deals over $1M will be streamlined in their review to facilitate Q4 close.*

- **Date**: May 1, 2023
- **Workspace**: Marketplace offers
- **Impacted audience**: Top-tier partners with marketplace offers

To keep the momentum going for completing transactions in the Microsoft commercial marketplace in Q4 FY23, there are two updates to Azure IP Co-sell to be aware of:

- **First**, Microsoft is enhancing the process for deals valued at more than $1 million dollars. Specifically, the waiting period for uplift validation is being eliminated, allowing these deals to be credited within this fiscal year.
  
  To streamline Q4 marketplace deal processing, all marketplace deals over $1M will be streamlined so the marketplace high value deals equal or above $1M registered from April 1, 2023, will undergo the review call for POE requirement verification (or DCF if PPP) to ensure timely validation to be captured within fiscal for FY23 results.

- **Second**, for all other deals closed in the commercial marketplace, only deals registered from April 1, 2023, will be allowed to roll over until September 30, 2023, to meet the incremental value required for approval.
 
 
#### Next steps

- Ensure deals are accurately indicated as marketplace deals during the deal registration submission.
- For details on the fields to be entered in the form, see the [Azure IP Co-sell deal registration document](../../../register-deals.md#azure-ip-co-sell-deal-registration-exception-process).
