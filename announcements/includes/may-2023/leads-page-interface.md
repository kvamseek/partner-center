## The Referral Leads details page is more responsive and easier to use

*The Leads tab in the Referrals workspace has a new and improved look, including a familiar grid view similar to the Co-sell opportunities page.*

- **Date**: May 10, 2023
- **Workspace**: Referrals
- **Impacted audience**: Referral admins

As part of a larger effort to improve the experience and performance of the Referrals workspace, we’ve updated the look for the Leads pages.

While the main pages have familiar grid views, the **Lead details** page has updates to make the page more responsive and easier to use.  

#### Try the new views out today and share your feedback with us!

Sign in to [Partner Center](https://partner.microsoft.com/dashboard/home) and select **Referrals workspace** > **Leads grid view**.

To learn more, see the [Referrals user guide](./../../../referrals-user-guide.md)
