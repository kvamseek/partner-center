## Microsoft 365 Multi-Geo capabilities add-on SKU coming to CSP

*Beginning June 1, 2023, the Multi-Geo capabilities add-on SKU will be available in the Cloud Solution Provider (CSP) new commerce experience (NCE).*

- **Date**: May 1, 2023
- **Workspace**: Customers
- **Impacted audience**: CSP direct bill partners and indirect providers, and resellers through their indirect providers

Multi-Geo will enhance the value of partners’ Microsoft productivity business, by giving their customers the ability to meet global data residency requirements within their Microsoft 365 tenant. Customers can expand their Microsoft 365 presence to multiple regions within an existing Microsoft 365 tenant, through the creation of new satellite geography locations to host users’ data.

Microsoft 365 Multi-Geo is an add-on SKU with three purchase options available for partners or customers who are managing Microsoft 365 subscriptions in new commerce:

1. One-year subscription paid monthly
1. One-year subscription paid annually
1. One-month trial subscription

Because this add-on SKU is user level, partners need subscription licenses for each user to be hosted in a customer’s satellite geography location. CSP partners must purchase a number of Multi-Geo licenses equal to or greater than 5 percent of their customer’s total eligible Microsoft 365 subscription seats.

Multi-Geo will be available to CSP partners in the NCE license-based price list preview on May 1, 2023, and in production on June 1, 2023.
