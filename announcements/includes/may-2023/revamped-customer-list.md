## View the revamped customer list with new and improved features

*We've made it easier to create new customer orders and work with customer tags.*

- **Date:** May 16, 2023
- **Workspace**: Customers
- **Impacted audience**: Partners transacting through the Cloud Solution Provider program.

We're excited to announce the redesigned landing page of the **Customers** workspace, the **Customer list** page with new features that aim to provide an improved user experience for our partners. With simplified navigation aimed at enhancing productivity, partners are able to create a new order for a specific customer directly from the customer list page, and manage and assign tags for more streamlined customer management. To learn even more about these changes, see:

- [Manage your customer list](./../../../see-your-customer-list.md)
- [Manage your customers with tags](./../../../manage-customers-with-tags.md).

#### Next steps

If you're ready to take advantage of these exciting upgrades, sign in to the Partner Center now to explore the revamped landing page in the Customers workspace.
