## Sell your Azure Kubernetes Service (AKS)-based apps on Azure Marketplace

*Custom meters for transactable Kubernetes apps are now available on Azure Marketplace.*

- **Date:** May 18, 2023
- **Workspace:** Marketplace offers
- **Impacted audience:** Commercial independent software vendors (ISVs) in the Azure Marketplace

We’re thrilled to announce our new custom meters feature. Before you publish your application on the marketplace, you can create a Kubernetes application that’s charged based on custom billing dimensions (such as bandwidth, transactions, and emails processed). Customers pay according to their consumption of these dimensions, with your application informing Microsoft of billable events via the commercial marketplace metering API. You can also add multiple dimensions and tier the pricing logic in your application to meet your unique billing needs. Moreover, with marketplace insights, you can now track customer adoption and gain valuable insights specific to your custom metering, like the detailed insights you gain for predefined billing.

#### What are the benefits of custom meters?

1. **Flexible pricing:** Because customers have varying usage patterns, you can tailor your Kubernetes application to cater to these different dimensions. You can also monetize any dimension that aligns with your application’s unique attributes, making it a win-win for you and your customers.
1. **Increased revenue:** With custom meters, you can monetize both fixed and variable billing dimensions. These meters allow you to capture additional usage beyond an initial fixed bill, helping boost your revenue over time and retain your customer base.
1. **Enhanced business agility:** Custom meters allow you to adapt to changing custom needs and factor in multiple billing dimensions based on their varying budget constraints. It’s a flexible solution that helps you meet the unique needs of your customers.
