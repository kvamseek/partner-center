## New assessments-related insights for the Surface Reseller Alliance program

_Surface PC Partners can now review assessment-related insights on the Surface insights summary page_

- **Date**: October 9, 2023

This new feature in the Surface insights summary page helps you see all individual users across the Partner Global ID who have completed the Surface related assessments. This new widget has two pivots that display details across the new and old lists of assessments. The table lists individual level details, and the chart displays the overall count for each assessment. The data displayed in the table includes data from individuals across the Partner Global ID with their name, email, course completion date and the course name.
