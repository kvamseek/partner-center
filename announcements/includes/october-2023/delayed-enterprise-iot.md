## Delayed until November 2023: Enterprise IoT protection included with Microsoft 365 E5

_Microsoft Defender for IoT – Enterprise IoT protection will be included with Microsoft 365 E5 subscriptions and available as a per device add-on for Microsoft Defender for Endpoint P2 customers to purchase in Partner Center by November 2023._

- **Date**: October 3, 2023
- **Workspace**: General
- **Impacted audience**: Direct bill partners, indirect providers, and indirect resellers transacting through the Cloud Solution Provider (CSP) program

On September 1, 2023, Partners were given a price list preview that showed:

- A new SKU: Microsoft Defender for IoT – EIoT Device License – add-on
- Information explaining that Microsoft Defender for IoT - Enterprise IoT protection would be included in Microsoft 365 E5 and E5 Security plans for up to 5 eIoT devices per user subscription.

Both items mentioned above were expected to be generally available to customers and partners via Partner Center in October 2023. Due to a slight delay, a decision was made to postpone the launch until November 1, 2023. The Microsoft Defender for IoT – EIoT Device License – add-on SKU currently appears on the Partner Center price list as purchasable, however we ask that you don't purchase this SKU until November 1, 2023.

- **Microsoft Defender for IoT – EIoT Device License - add-on**: Microsoft Defender for Endpoint P2 customers can get real-time device discovery, continuous monitoring, and vulnerability management capabilities for eIoT devices licensed per device.

#### Next steps

- Disregard/do not purchase the _Microsoft Defender for IoT – EIoT Device License – add-on_ SKU for Microsoft Defender for Endpoint P2 customers until November 1, 2023.
- Inform customers that Microsoft Defender for IoT – Enterprise IoT protection won't be available in Microsoft 365 E5 and E5 Security SKUs until November 1, 2023.
- Share with customers interested in purchasing Microsoft 365 E5 and E5 Security SKUs before November 1, 2023, that Microsoft Defender for IoT – Enterprise IoT protection will be backfilled to those SKUs by the end of November should they desire to purchase Microsoft 365 E5 or E5 Security SKUs before November 1, 2023.
