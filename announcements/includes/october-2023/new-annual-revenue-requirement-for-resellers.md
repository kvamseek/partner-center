## New annual revenue requirement for CSP indirect resellers

_Starting in April 2024, indirect resellers must have a minimum revenue amount to remain authorized to transact as Cloud Solution Providers._

- **Date**: October 02, 2023
- **Workspace**: General
- **Impacted audience**: CSP Indirect Resellers and Indirect Providers

Beginning April 1, 2024, existing Cloud Solution Provider (CSP) indirect resellers must have a minimum of USD1000 in trailing 12 months (TTM) CSP revenue (including Perpetual Software) at the reseller tenant level in each of the CSP regions in which they sell. The revenue requirement must be met annually, on the reseller's tenant onboarding anniversary date, for the reseller to remain authorized to transact as a CSP.

This requirement applies only to CSP indirect reseller tenants that have been authorized for at least one year.

The new requirement is the latest in a series of steps by Microsoft to accelerate revenue growth and upgrade the sales and product expertise, solutions and services delivery, compliance, security protocols, and support skills of CSP partners.

Starting in January 2024, indirect resellers and their indirect provider(s) will be notified 90 days in advance of reseller's onboarding anniversary month if the indirect reseller isn't meeting the revenue requirement, enabling the indirect reseller and their indirect provider(s) to work together to meet the requirement.

Both the indirect reseller and their indirect provider(s) will be sent an enforcement notification during the indirect reseller's onboarding anniversary month informing them that the reseller will be deauthorized from selling with indirect providers if the indirect reseller has less than USD1000 in TTM CSP revenue associated with the reseller's tenant. After deauthorization, the reseller must wait at least one year before reenrolling for indirect reseller status.

#### Next steps

- Indirect resellers should connect with their indirect provider(s) to work together on meeting the revenue requirement by April 1, 2024.
