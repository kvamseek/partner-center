## New commerce launch and migration timeline for Cloud Solution Provider Government Community Cloud, education, and nonprofit legacy offers

_Update on new commerce launch and migration timeline for Cloud Solution Provider (CSP) Government Community Cloud, education, and nonprofit legacy offers._

- **Date**: October 18, 2023
- **Workspace**: General
- **Impacted audience**: CSP Direct Bill and Indirect Resellers, Indirect Providers

In July, Microsoft announced that CSP legacy Public Sector offers for Government Community Cloud, education and nonprofit would be available in CSP new commerce in November 2023. However, we have received feedback from partners that making system changes at the end of the calendar year would be difficult. As a result, we have adjusted the timeline.

Microsoft will launch CSP public sector offers in the new commerce system starting January 1, 2024. To give partners time to adjust to this change, Microsoft-led migration of public sector offers will begin starting July 1, 2024. We'll share the full launch and migration plan in mid-November 2023.

#### Next steps

Familiarize yourself with [migration resources](../../../migrate-subscriptions-to-new-commerce.md). Additional information will be shared in mid-November.
