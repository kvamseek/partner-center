## Referral Inbound routing rules page has moved

_We've moved the Inbound routing rules page into the Referrals workspace from Account settings for easier co-sell configuration._

- **Date**: October 2, 2023
- **Workspace**: Referrals
- **Impacted audience**: Referrals admins

The **Routing rules** page has now been moved into the **Co-sell** section of the **Referrals** workspace to make it easier to access and configure rules for large partner organizations. Routing rules are used to send referrals from Microsoft sellers to different locations within the Partner organization automatically. Until October 30, both pages will be accessible to Partners. Learn more at [Create and manage inbound opportunities routing rules - Partner Center](../../../routing-rules.md).
