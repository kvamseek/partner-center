## Now Live: Transactability of Business Central apps to AppSource

_Independent Software Vendor (ISV) partners can publish their Dynamics 365 Business Central transactable apps to the Microsoft AppSource marketplace._

- **Date**: October 10, 2023
- **Workspace**: General
- **Impacted audience**: ISV partners of Business Central

Business Central partners can now create offers with priced plans in Partner Center and list them on AppSource, enabling customers to purchase licenses through Microsoft's commerce engine. This allows partners to opt out of managing their own purchases and licensing solutions, and lean on Microsoft for app licensing and customer management needs. This capability has been running in public preview since February 2023 and will be generally available from October 9, 2023.

Microsoft partners can grow their business globally through the commercial marketplace. The new release simplifies sales, offers two selling methods (one-to-many via AppSource and one-to-one via private deals), allows migration of current commerce business to save infrastructure costs, and helps attract new customers through AppSource's reach.

Your customers can solve all their business challenges in one place, with one invoice, through one trusted sourceâ€”the commercial marketplace, which can include the products you sell on AppSource.
