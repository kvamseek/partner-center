## Update on changes to Microsoft 365 and Teams licensing in Europe

_Changes to Microsoft 365 and Teams licensing in Europe beginning on October 1, 2023._

- **Date**: October 20, 2023
- **Workspace**: General
- **Impacted audience**: Cloud Solution Provider (CSP) Direct Bill Partners, CSP Indirect Resellers, CSP Indirect Providers, Licensing Solution Provider

**UPDATE:** Effective October 1, 2023, we're offering a new lineup of Microsoft 365, Office 365, and Microsoft Teams SKUs in the European Economic Area (EEA) and Switzerland. This lineup provides customers with the option of purchasing Teams separately from Microsoft 365 and Office 365. Existing Microsoft 365 E3/E5 and Office 365 E1/E3/E5 suites should no longer be sold to net new customers in the EEA or Switzerland. As we work to ensure a smooth transition for customers, some backend processes might be delayed (for example, removal from price lists and catalog). The policy that existing suites shouldn't be sold to net new customers after October 1 remains the same.

Microsoft is making important changes to the licensing and availability of Microsoft 365 and Microsoft Teams in the EEA and Switzerland. We're making these changes in response to feedback from the European Commission (EC). We believe that this new licensing approach takes meaningful steps to address the EC's feedback while limiting disruption for customers and partners.

**What's changing?**

Starting on October 1, 2023, we'll introduce a new lineup of commercial Microsoft 365 and Office 365 suites in the EEA and Switzerland that don't include Teams, and a new standalone Teams offering for Enterprise customers. Existing customers in the EEA and Switzerland who wish to continue using the suites to which they have already subscribed can continue to use, renew, and add seats to their current plans as usual. This new lineup will:

- Introduce new EEA/Switzerland-specific suites without Teams, which will be named the same as the full suites plus "EEA (no Teams)."

- Introduce a new EEA-specific standalone Teams SKU for Enterprise: Microsoft Teams EEA

- End the sale of net-new subscriptions to all existing Enterprise SKUs with Teams (Office 365 E1/E3/E5 and Microsoft 365 E3/E5) in the EEA and Switzerland

- Continue to offer existing SMB and Frontline suites with Teams (Business Basic/Standard/Premium, Microsoft 365 F1, Microsoft 365 F3, Office 365 F3) alongside the new versions without Teams.
