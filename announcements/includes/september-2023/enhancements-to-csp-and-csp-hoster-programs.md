## Upcoming enhancements to the CSP and CSP-Hoster programs

_We're announcing new offers and benefits for our customers and partners in the Cloud Solution Provider (CSP) program and the CSP-Hoster program._

- **Date**: September 1, 2023
- **Workspace**: Pricing
- **Impacted audience**: CSP partners, CSP-Hosters, and SPLA partners

In [October 2022](../../index.md), we expanded the CSP program and introduced hosting benefits under the CSP-Hoster offering. Our goal is to empower partners to build hosted solutions with speed and scale and for their customers to bring their own licenses to hoster.

We're excited to announce upcoming enhancements in CSP with new product offers that benefit our CSP customers and partners, extending them to CSP-Hosters.

We're also thrilled to announce significant reduction and simplification to reporting in the CSP-Hoster program.

The following offers will be introduced starting October 1, 2023:

- **System Center subscriptions**

  CSP partners can offer System Center as either a 36-month or 12-month subscription to their customers for use on-premises or with an Authorized Outsourcer. CSP-Hoster partners can also offer System Center as part of their hosted solutions to customers.

- **Extended security updates (ESUs)**

  CSP partners will be able to offer ESUs for end of support versions of Windows Server and SQL Server.

  Customers will then have the right to use licenses covered by ESUs on deployments on-premises or within outsourced environments running on Authorized Outsourcers. Customers may also apply ESU licenses to "license-included" workloads acquired from Services Provider Licensing Agreement (SPLA) partners or CSP-Hosters.

  CSP-Hoster partners will also be able to provide hosted fulfillment of Windows Server and SQL Server software out of mainstream support that is supported by corresponding ESU licenses also purchased as license included or bring-your-license (BYOL).

##### ESU eligibility requirements

Customers will require Software Assurance (SA) or an equivalent subscription to be eligible to buy the associated ESU. Perpetual licenses only don't qualify.

However, a customer doesn't require SA or subscription to utilize ESUs with license-included services purchased from SPLA providers.

##### ESU prerequisite rules

For years 2 and 3 of each ESU, customers must have purchased the prior year(s). For example, to use year 3 ESU, customer must also have purchased years 1 and 2.

##### Planned ESU pricing\*

##### Simpler and less reporting

Starting October 1, 2023, we're making CSP-Hoster reporting simple and less frequent, including no longer requiring customer tenant ID information.

- **No more monthly reports:** CSP-Hoster reporting will be reduced to quarterly reporting versus monthly. Just one each for the quarterly periods of January-March, April-June, July-September, and October-December.
- **No more customer tenant ID**: CSP-Hosters no longer need to provide customer tenant IDs for either license-included or BYOL.
- **Fewer products to be reported:** Partners may continue to offer license-included services for the many products in CSP, or accept customer BYOL for eligible products. They will no longer need to report all products. Quarterly reporting will be for just six products.
- **Secure submission via Partner Center:** Quick and simple uploads.

CSP-Hosters continue to benefit from the customer BYOL and the simplified verification process introduced on April 1, 2023, which remains unchanged.

_\*Dates are subject to change._
