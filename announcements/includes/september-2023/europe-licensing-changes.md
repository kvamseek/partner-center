## Changes to Microsoft 365 and Teams licensing in Europe

*Changes to Microsoft 365 and Teams licensing in Europe will take effect on October 1, 2023.*

- **Date:** September 5, 2023
- **Workspace:** General
- **Impacted audience:** Cloud Solution Provider (CSP) direct bill partners, indirect resellers, and indirect providers

Microsoft is making important changes to the licensing and availability of Microsoft 365 and Microsoft Teams in the European Economic Area (EEA) and Switzerland. We're making these changes in response to feedback from the European Commission (EC). We believe that this new licensing approach takes meaningful steps to address the EC's feedback while limiting disruption for customers and partners.

##### What's changing?

Starting October 1, 2023, we'll introduce a new lineup of commercial Microsoft 365 and Office 365 suites in the EEA and Switzerland that don't include Teams, and a new standalone Teams offering for Enterprise customers. Existing customers in the EEA and Switzerland who wish to continue using the suites to which they have already subscribed may continue to use, renew, and add seats to their current plans as usual. 

This new lineup will do the following: 

- Introduce new EEA- and Switzerland-specific suites without Teams, which will be named the same as the full suites plus "EEA (no Teams)."
- Introduce a new EEA-specific standalone Teams SKU for Enterprise: Microsoft Teams EEA.
- End the sale of net-new subscriptions to all existing Enterprise SKUs with Teams (Office 365 E1/E3/E5 and Microsoft 365 E3/E5) in the EEA and Switzerland.
- Continue to offer existing SMB and Frontline suites with Teams (Business Basic/Standard/Premium, Microsoft 365 F1, Microsoft 365 F3, and Office 365 F3) alongside the new versions without Teams.
