- [Discounting, transparency, and passthrough](https://microsoft.sharepoint.com/teams/PartnerDealExecutionPlaybook/SitePages/Discounting,-Transparency-%26-Passthrough.aspx)
- [Additional resellers](https://microsoft.sharepoint.com/teams/PartnerDealExecutionPlaybook/SitePages/Additional-Resellers.aspx)

We overhauled the customer purchase commitment section, and provided language clarification in the other listed sections.
