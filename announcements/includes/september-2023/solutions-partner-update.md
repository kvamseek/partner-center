## Monthly Update: What’s new for Solutions Partner designations, specializations, and other program offerings and benefits

*Important capabilities, offers and updates have been introduced to improve the way partners can further differentiate their deep technical expertise across a set of priority scenarios with high customer demand.*

- **Date:** September 26, 2023
- **Workspace:** General
- **Impacted audience:** Partners enrolled in the Microsoft AI Cloud Partner Program

#### Available now

- **Expansion of the Solutions Partner designation qualification window from 30 days to 180 days**—effective September 19, 2023, we expanded the qualification window for the Solutions Partner designation. For renewing partners, the qualification window is moving from the 30 days after your anniversary date to the five full months prior to your anniversary date plus the month of the anniversary date. If you qualify at any time in that qualification window, you're eligible to renew at your renewal window, even if your score falls below 70 again before your renewal window. For new partners, the qualification window changes from the date of qualification to the five months before the day you qualify, plus the months of qualification. Once you’ve qualified, you have 30 days to enroll. For more details, read the updated [article](../../../partner-capability-score.md) in Partner Center.

> [!NOTE]
>  If you are not enrolled in a designation today, your qualification window end date will always be the current date, and will roll forward every day. If you are enrolled in a designation, your qualification window for that designation will close on a specific date relative to your anniversary date. You can find your qualification window dates by solution area in **[Partner Center](https://partner.microsoft.com/dashboard/v2/membership/program/solutionspartner/solutionareas/overview)** on each designation details page, along with your highest historical scores for each of the last 6 months. Qualification windows will vary by solution area based on current enrollment status.

#### Coming soon

- **Training Services Partner designation and performance reports in Partner Center**—in early 2024, the Solutions Partner for Training Services designation will be available through a set of Learning Partner requirements in categories for number of learners trained, certifications purchased, training delivery quality and capability across Microsoft solution areas.

- In Q3 CY 2023, the Training Services partner performance reports in Partner Center will be available to partners enrolled in the Microsoft AI Cloud Partner Program. Stay tuned for more updates when they become available via our [Learning Partner Community](https://techcommunity.microsoft.com/t5/microsoft-partner-community/ct-p/PartnerCommunity).

- Partner Support Services designation public preview—last month we announced the opening of the limited public preview for partners to get an early look at the designation and get on the fast track to qualifying when the program is fully available. Learn more about the criteria for joining the public preview and nominate yourself with this simple [form](https://forms.office.com/pages/responsepage.aspx?id=v4j5cvGGr0GRqy180BHbR2oQGHHjbaBGhh_N6Owj0F1UNFZEOVZGMUdOTVpDUFZFSEgyVTBGMFo2TS4u).

#### Reminders

- Legacy benefits are still available to partners who held a legacy competency on September 30, 2022. If your legacy benefits expired since October 2022 and you don't have an active benefit kit through a Solutions Partner designation, check [Partner Center offers](https://partner.microsoft.com/dashboard/v2/membership/offers) to see if you're eligible to renew your legacy benefits.
