## Tax invoice requirements for ISVs selling in Japan

*The purpose of this communication is to inform you that from October 1, 2023, the tax invoice (Tekikaku Seikyusho) will be introduced by the Japan Tax Authority.  Note that publishers and developers have sole responsibility to manage taxation.*

- **Date**: September 12, 2023
- **Workspace**: Billing
- **Impacted audience**: Publishers and developers who are registered as qualified tax invoice issuers (Tekikaku Seikyusho Hakko Jigyosha)

On October 1, 2023, the tax invoice (Tekikaku Seikyusho) will be introduced by the Japan Tax Authority.  

Note that publishers and developers have sole responsibility to determine all compliance required for, and to manage, End Customer Taxation including but not limited to registration, tax calculation, tax collection, tax remittance, validation of business status of customers and providing tax invoices to customers.  

Microsoft acts as an agent or commissionaire (as applicable) of the publisher or developer. Microsoft will keep issuing commercial invoices; however, such commercial invoices don't qualify as tax invoices (Tekikaku Seikyusho).
