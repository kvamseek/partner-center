## Transfer Azure savings plans between partners in Partner Center

_We have enabled the ability for Cloud Solution Provider (CSP) partners to transfer Azure savings plans between CSP partners within Partner Center._

- **Date**: September 14, 2023
- **Workspace**: Customers
- **Impacted audience**: Direct bill partners, indirect providers, and indirect resellers transacting through the CSP program

The Azure savings plan for compute was made available to customers and partners in October 2022. At the time of launch, Azure savings plan was only available to CSP partners through the Azure portal. On June 15, 2023, it became available in Partner Center.

We've enabled the ability for CSP partners to transfer savings plans to other CSP partners from within Partner Center in production. This feature is generally available for Admin Agent roles as of September 14, 2023.
