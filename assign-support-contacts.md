# Assign a reseller as a technical support contact for customers

**Appropriate roles**: Admin agent | Global admin | Helpdesk agent

When you set up subscriptions for Microsoft services for your customers, you may want to assign the technical support for these products to a designated reseller, rather than providing the support yourself.

After you set up support contacts, customers can see your assigned support contact's information on the product support pages. For example, when Office 365 customers need support, they can go into the Office.com page, sign in with their admin credentials, select **Admin**, and under the **Support** section, see the assigned support contact information.

This can be used for [multi-partner](multipartner.md) and [multi-channel](multichannel.md) scenarios.

## Assign contacts

Use the following steps to assign contacts.

1. [Request a relationship](request-a-relationship-with-a-customer.md) with your designated product reseller. Negotiate a support agreement with them for handling technical support.

2. Sign in to [Partner Center](https://partner.microsoft.com/dashboard/home) and select **Customers**.

3. Select a customer, then select a subscription (for example, Office 365 Business Standard).

4. In  **Designated support contact**, select the designated product reseller, and then select **Submit**.

> [!NOTE]
> For new subscriptions, the designated support contact defaults to the indirect provider. You can also change this to an indirect reseller that has delegated admin privileges.
> If the reseller's name doesn't appear in the list of available support contacts, add them in by [requesting a relationship](request-a-relationship-with-a-customer.md). They will appear in the list after the relationship is established.

5. Review that the changes are correct, and then select **Close**.
