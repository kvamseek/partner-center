# Azure IP co-sell top-tier benefits

Co-sell is a benefit of your Microsoft AI Cloud Partner Program membership. As you invest in your partnership with us and grow your business, we’ll invest in your organization through additional co-sell benefits, which include top-tier benefits.

From July 1, 2023, if you have met the requirements to become Azure IP co-sell eligible (which include having a transactable offer published in the commercial marketplace), the purchase of your solution can help count toward customers' existing cloud commitments. If your organization meets additional requirements, you can qualify for top-tier benefits (such as seller incentivization and eligibility to participate in PRACR).

To meet the additional requirements for top-tier benefits, you can choose to take one of the following strategic pathways: **marketplace performance** or **consumption commitments**. Please review the below criteria of the two distinct pathways.

- **Marketplace performance:** The marketplace performance path recognizes partners with high-performing solutions in the marketplace based on the trailing twelve-month (TTM) evaluation periods. To access top-tier benefits this way, partners must meet **one** of the following criteria:
  - USD $4 million marketplace billed sales (MBS) transactions
  - 12 net-new customer adds to marketplace of greater than USD $10,000 each
    - “Net-new” here means net-new to the Microsoft commercial marketplace (not net-new to Microsoft) and/or net-new to the specific partner.
  - 30 marketplace transactions with eight unique customers
    -  Must be at a minimum value of USD $100
- **Consumption commitments:** The consumption commitments path recognizes partners who have signed material cloud consumption commitments with customers. To access top-tier benefits via this path, partners must meet **one** of the following criteria:
  - Partners themselves must sign a USD $30 million cloud consumption commitment, and the partner must have at least five marketplace transactions, **OR**
  - Partners themselves must have signed a USD $200 million cloud consumption commitment and the partner must have a transactable listing in the marketplace

By meeting the criteria of one of the above pathways—marketplace performance or consumption commitments—you can qualify for top-tier benefits. In addition, when you sell directly to Microsoft customers with a Microsoft Azure Cloud Commitment (MACC), Microsoft sellers will be incentivized to sell your eligible Azure solutions and can more easily identify you and promote leads to your organization. Partners who qualify for top-tier benefits can choose to take additional actions to access PRACR, an exclusive SaaS joint-sales offering.
