## What are Azure Reservations?

Azure Reservations help you save money by prepaying for one-year or three-years of Azure resources, such as virtual machines, SQL Database compute capacity, and Azure Cosmos DB throughput. Prepaying allows you to get a discount on the resources you use. Reservations can significantly reduce your virtual machine, SQL database compute, Azure Cosmos DB, and other resource costs up to 72% compared to pay-as-you-go prices. Reservations provide a billing discount and don't affect the runtime state of your resources. For more information, see [What are Azure Reservations?](/azure/billing/billing-save-compute-costs-reservations)

## Why should customers buy a reservation?

If customers have virtual machines, Azure Cosmos DB, or SQL databases that run for long periods of time, purchasing a reservation gives them the most cost-effective option. For example, if a customer continuously runs four instances of a service without a reservation, they're charged at pay-as-you-go rates. If they purchase a reservation for those resources, they immediately get the reservation discount. The resources are no longer charged at the pay-as-you-go rates.

### Compelling New Azure offer in CSP

By bringing Azure Reservations and Server Subscriptions to its CSP program, Microsoft is better enabling its partners to address fast-growing customer demand for more cost-effective solutions to support highly predictable, persistent cloud workloads. The CSP program enables partners to acquire, provision, and manage Azure Reservations and Server Subscriptions on behalf of commercial customers via Microsoft Partner Center and Azure portal.

We even give partners in our CSP program choices about how Azure reservations can be purchased. You can [buy Azure reservations on behalf of a customer](azure-reservations-buying.md), or you can [allow the customer to buy their own reservations](give-customers-permission.md) from a prior Azure subscription the partner has purchased for them.

Azure Reservations give customers the flexibility of virtualization for a wide range of computing solutions, including development and testing, running applications, and extending the data center.

With [Azure Reserved VM Instances](https://azure.microsoft.com/pricing/reserved-vm-instances/), for example, commercial customers can now save up to 72% versus pay-as-you-go Azure VM pricing simply by purchasing&mdash;or "reserving"&mdash;the virtual machine for a one-year or three-year period. Windows Server customers with Azure Hybrid Benefit, included with Software Assurance, will be able to save up to 80% versus pay-as-you-go pricing.

With an unmatched combination of compelling pricing and unmatched deployment flexibility, customers will see the best overall value when they choose Azure Reservations.

## Azure Hybrid Benefit

The [Azure Hybrid Benefit](https://azure.microsoft.com/pricing/hybrid-benefit) is a pricing benefit for customers who have licenses with Software Assurance. Azure Hybrid Benefit helps maximize the value of existing on-premises Windows Server and/or SQL Server license investments when migrating to Azure. Eligible customers can save up to 40%\* on Azure Virtual Machines (infrastructure as a service, or IaaS). They can save up to 55% on Azure SQL Database (platform as a service, or PaaS) and SQL Server on Azure Virtual Machines (IaaS) with Azure Hybrid Benefit, which increases to up to 80% when combined with Azure Reserved Instances.

\* Actual savings may vary based on region, instance type, or usage.
