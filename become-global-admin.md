# Find and become the Global admin

**Appropriate roles**: Global admin | Account admin

To add or remove users in Partner Center, you must become a Global admin for your company.

## Verify your domain ownership to become a Global admin in Partner Center

To become a Global admin for your company, verify domain ownership using the following steps:

1. Sign in to [Partner Center](https://partner.microsoft.com/dashboard/home) and select **Membership**.

2. Select **Become a Global admin**.

3. On the **Verify domain ownership** page, copy the TXT values from the table.

   Notice that your domain is already selected for you.

4. Sign in to your domain.

5. Follow the steps your domain provides to paste the TXT values into the DNS form.

   Doing so allows us to verify that you own the domain you're trying to work from.

6. Return to Partner Center and select **Okay, I've added the record**.

7. After verification is complete, you must sign out.

8. Sign in again to refresh your status.

- Access all Microsoft account/services with full privileges.
- Create support tickets for the Partner Center.
- View agreements, price lists, and offers.
- Do billing.
- View, create, and manage partner users.
- Purchase and manage cloud services.
