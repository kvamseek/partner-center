# Troubleshoot issues with accessing CHIP

**Appropriate roles**: Primary contact or program admin

> [!NOTE]
> You won't be able to access the Channel Incentives Platform (CHIP) portal by using Live ID after March 18, 2022. You should use your Partner Center credentials to access the CHIP portal.

If you aren't the primary contact or Primary Program Administrator (PPA), contact your primary contact or PPA for access. If you are the current PPA, make sure your company is registered and enrolled, as your access is tied to your company status.

If you are the primary contact or PPA, you should have access to CHIP, as all notifications for registration are sent to the current primary contact or PPA. This access continues for each period after the initial registration period.

## Troubleshooting steps to assist with accessing CHIP if you had prior access

1. Clear all cookies and open CHIP in a private browser.
1. Select **Compatibility View Settings** in your browser. CHIP should be already listed under Microsoft.com; otherwise, add the website.
