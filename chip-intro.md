# Navigate the Channel Incentives Platform (CHIP)

**Appropriate roles**: Incentives admin or Incentives user

The *Channel Incentives Platform* (CHIP) provides access to incentives data for Microsoft Channel Incentives programs, and shows updated earning details for selling Microsoft products.

## Manage users

Only someone in your organization with the *Incentive administrator* role can enroll in [incentive programs](https://partner.microsoft.com/partnership/partner-incentives). An Incentive administrator must be assigned for the location PartnerIDs.

If there's no Incentive administrator for your location, a Global administrator or Account administrator must assign one. (A Global administrator or Account administrator can also be an Incentive administrator.) A Global administrator can also assign an Incentive administrator in Azure Active Directory (Azure AD).

- To learn the about roles that can be assigned to users so they can initiate, manage, edit, dispute, or view in the *Incentives* workspace, see the [Manage incentives](permissions-overview.md#manage-incentives) section of the article [Assign roles, permissions, and workspace access to users](permissions-overview.md).

- For information about partner accounts, roles, and permissions, see [Manage your Partner Center account](partner-center-account-setup.md).

## Enrollment process

When your organization is eligible for incentives, Microsoft sends an invitation to the Incentive administrator of the eligible LocationID to begin the enrollment process.

The invitation email is sent from *Microsoft Partner Center* and has the subject line *Partner Incentive Enrollment Invitation*.

To enroll, open the invitation email and select **Get Started**.

## View performance and earnings in the CHIP dashboard

To view performance and earnings in the CHIP dashboard, use the following steps:

1. Sign in to [CHIP](https://channelincentives.microsoft.com) using your Azure AD credentials.

1. Select the program that you want to access.
