# Find your Solution Assessments opportunity status on CHIP

**Appropriate roles**: Primary contact or program admin

Partners can review a Solution Assessments opportunity status on the Channel Incentives Platform (CHIP).

## Determine the status of your deal

Ensure that your deal has reached the eligible sales stage and that it's approved by the Solution Assessment Specialist (SAS).

To check sales stage and approval, use the following steps:

1. Sign in to CHIP with your credentials.
1. In **Opportunity ID**, enter the ID number of the opportunity.
1. Select **Search**.

1. In the **POE** column, select **View** and review the status of the opportunity. If the opportunity is in the **Submit** status, the Proof of Execution (POE) documents must be submitted to move forward in the payment process.

1. Select **Edit** to check if all the POE documents have been uploaded. Note whether there's POE uploaded and that **EM Approval** is selected.

1. Return to search results and select the relevant deal name to retrieve the deal details.

1. Based on the information found using steps 4 to 6, determine if the minimum requirements for incentive earning have been met. If any requirement hasn't been met, do the following steps:

   1. If POE hasn't been uploaded, upload it to CHIP.

   1. Open CHIP and sign in with your Microsoft Account (previously *Live ID*).

   1. Select **Solutions Assessments Incentives**.

   1. In the **I need toâ€¦** section, select **Search Deals**.

   1. Enter the Opportunity ID in the **Opportunity** box, and select **Search**.

   1. When the Opportunity is visible, select **Submit**.

   1. In the new POE menu, go to the required POE document and select it.

   1. Select **Upload Document**.

   1. Repeat these steps as many times as needed to upload all required documents.

   1. After all the documents are uploaded, select **Submit**.

If the **EM approval** checkbox isn't checked, contact your SAS to review and provide the approval.
