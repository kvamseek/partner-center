# Eligibility requirements for the Solution Assessment Incentives Program

**Appropriate roles**: Primary contact or program admin

Partners with active and enrolled status in the Solution Assessment Incentive Program in FY20 will continue to be eligible for incentives in FY21 if they have an active Microsoft AI Cloud Partner Program membership and an active Silver or Gold Microsoft AI Cloud Partner Program competency. Partner qualifications are reviewed for eligibility annually. If established partners don't accomplish eligibility and participation requirements in the current year, they'll be removed in the next annual review. All new partners are onboarded through the local Solution Assessment Specialist (SAS) in their area. The SAS identifies partners to be onboarded by matching skills and expertise in the partner company and the business needs of the subsidiaries supported by the SAS.

Prior to starting the onboarding process, partners will need to discuss with the SAS the capabilities their company has in supporting assessments in their localities.

Partners not currently enrolled in an incentive program must meet the FY21 incentive criteria to be eligible for Solution Assessment Incentive onboarding.
