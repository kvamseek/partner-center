# Earn cooperative marketing funds

**Appropriate roles**: Incentives admin | Incentives user

Cooperative (co-op) marketing  funds are funds that you earn through Microsoft Incentive Programs by claiming reimbursement for activities that support Microsoft product awareness.

Examples of Microsoft Incentives Programs are the Cloud Solution Provider, Managed Reseller, Hosting, and Surface PC and Surface Hub Reseller incentives programs.

Co-op funds help you to conduct marketing activities that increase brand awareness and drive growth of your sales pipeline.

You can invest co-op funds in activities to facilitate readiness, develop specializations, or attain Microsoft certificationsâ€”activities that foster focused solution practices and Centers of Excellence.

To learn more about co-op funds, see [Co-op Funds Resources](https://partner.microsoft.com/asset/collection/co-op-funds-resources#/).

> [!IMPORTANT]
>Co-op claims do not apply to the *Online Services Advisory (OSA) Sell*, *Online Services Usage (OSU)-Microsoft 365*, or *OSU-Business Application* incentive programs. To submit a claim for one of these programs, see [Create a customer association using the CPOR model](submit-osa-claim.md).

## How co-op funds are calculated

Microsoft calculates eligible incentive earnings using a percentage split (such as 60% rebate, 40% co-op). You receive the rebate portion at the existing payout cadence for your individual program, and Microsoft accrues the co-op portion of incentive earnings.

To learn more about the payout cadence and percentage split in your incentives program, see [your incentive program guide](https://partner.microsoft.com/membership/partner-incentives).

> [!NOTE]
> If your co-op earnings are below the threshold in the co-op earning period, your co-op earnings are converted to a rebate at the end of the semester. For details or to determine the threshold amount, see [co-op threshold](claims-threshold.md).

## When to claim your funds

The timeline for co-op funds is divided into two six-month periods, H1 and H2. (The "H" stands for half of a fiscal year.)

- H1 is the first half of the fiscal year, July 1 - December 31.
- H2 is the second half of the fiscal year, January 1 - June 30.

You accrue earnings during a six-month *earning period*.

You must use your reimbursement during the following six-month *usage period*.

You can claim reimbursement during a six-month *claiming period*.

If you don't use your earnings by the end of the usage period, you forfeit them.

The following table shows examples of earning, usage, and claiming periods.

|  If your earning period is  |Your fiscal half-year period is  |  Your usage period is  |  Your claiming period is  |
| :-----------: | :-----------: | :-----------: | :-----------: |
|**July - Dec 2022**| FY23 H1  |  Jan - June 2023  |  Feb 16 - Aug 15 2023  |

|**Jan - June 2024** |  FY24 H2  |  July - Dec 2024  |  Aug 16 2024 - Feb 15 2025  |

Unless otherwise noted, periods extend from the first day of the first month to the last day of the last month.

> [!NOTE]
> Microsoft reserves the right to request original [proof of execution (PoE) documents](incentives-prepare-your-proof-of-execution.md). You should keep all of your original documents for 24 months after the activity date.
