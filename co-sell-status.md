# Verify co-sell status of a solution

**Appropriate roles**: Co-sell solution admin

You can verify the co-sell status of an offer on the **Co-sell solutions** page in the **Referrals** workspace of Partner Center.

## Verify co-sell status

To verify the co-sell status of a solution, use the following steps:

1. Sign in to [Partner Center](https://partner.microsoft.com/dashboard/home) and select **Referrals**.
2. Select **Co-sell solutions**.
   - You can verify the current co-sell status and incentives programs your solution is approved for in the grid.
   - You can alternatively select the solution name and open the pane to verify its current status (including if the status is currently under review).
