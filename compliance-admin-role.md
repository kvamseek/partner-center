# Compliance admin role in Partner Center

**Appropriate roles**: Account admin | Global admin | User management admin | Compliance admin

Microsoft is committed to building products and services that run on trust and acknowledge the important roles our Partners play to support our commitment. To help our Partners manage their compliance obligations, we're adding a new Compliance admin role in Partner Center intended to support Partners with managing compliance-related matters.

## Role of a Compliance admin

The Compliance admin role is intended to help Partners authorize a point of contact that they want Microsoft to engage with for compliance related matters. Ensure this role has been assigned to someone in your company and that the point of contact is kept current as change happens within your company. In addition to receiving compliance-related communication from Microsoft, the Compliance admin has the ability to perform the following actions in Partner Center:

1. Monitor account verification processes and upload required documentation for account verification. To learn more, see [Verify your account information - Partner Center | Microsoft Learn](./verification-responses.md).

1. Update legal business profile information. To learn more, see [Verify your company profile](./update-your-partner-profile.md).

1. Coordinate and complete required compliance training.

## Affected partners

All Microsoft AI Cloud Partner Program Partners, Cloud Solution Provider direct-bill, indirect provider, and indirect reseller Partners should have a compliance admin assigned to their Partner Center account.

## Assign Partner Center Compliance admin role to a user
