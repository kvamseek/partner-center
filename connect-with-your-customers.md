# Connect with customers

**Appropriate roles**: Global admin | Admin agent

This article describes how to invite a customer to establish a reseller relationship with you and how to remove that relationship.

To transact with customers in Partner Center:

- You must have a Partner Center account.
- Your customers must be set up in Partner Center.
- You must establish reseller relationships with your customers.
- Your indirect provider must also have reseller relationships with your customers to purchase subscriptions and services on your customer's behalf.

## Connect with existing customers

Once you successfully enroll as an indirect reseller, you'll see the same customers in Partner Center that you might already do business with in other portals, such Microsoft 365 admin center or the Azure portal.

- Sign in to [Partner Center](https://partner.microsoft.com/dashboard/home) and select **Customers**.

When you connect with an indirect provider, you don't automatically gain the indirect provider's customers.

Likewise, the customers you work with either on your own or through your indirect provider, but not through the Partner Center, won't automatically appear in your customer list when you enroll in the Partner Center.

You must establish a reseller relationship with customers to transact in the Partner Center. To do so, you email them an invitation to connect with you on Partner Center.

## Invite an existing customer to establish a reseller relationship with you

To invite a customer to a reseller relationship, use the following steps:

1. Sign in to [Partner Center](https://partner.microsoft.com/dashboard/home) and select **Customers**.
2. Select a customer from the **Customer list** and then select **Request a reseller relationship**.
3. On the next page, review the draft email message.

   You can open the draft message in email or you can copy the message to your clipboard and paste it into an email message.

   You can edit the draft email message, but be sure to include the URL because it's personalized to link the customer directly to your account.

4. Select **Done**.
5. Send the email to your customer.

   After your customer accepts your invitation, they appear on your **Customers** page. You can then manage their subscriptions and service from there.

6. To manage the customer's account, services, users, and licenses, select the customer's record and then select what you want to do.

## Connect with new customers

When you attract new customers, you'll need to connect with them on Partner Center. You can get new customers through multiple channels, including:

- Your own marketing activities
- Microsoft referrals
- Indirect providers

2. Select **New relationship** to invite a customer to establish a reseller relationship with both you and the indirect provider at the same time.

   The provider must have a reseller relationship with your customer so they can submit orders on your customer's behalf when the customer wants to buy new subscriptions or add new licenses to existing subscriptions.

3. On the next page, review the draft email message.

   You can open the draft message in email or you can copy the message to your clipboard and paste it into an email.

4. Select **Done**.

   After the customer authorizes you and your provider to be their resellers of record, you'll have administrator permissions to manage their subscriptions, licenses, and users on their behalf. Your indirect provider can also submit orders on their behalf.
