# Troubleshoot co-sell referrals connectors

**Applies to**: Dynamics 365 CRM | Salesforce CRM

**Appropriate roles**: Referrals admin | System admin or System customizer on the CRM

This article covers [co-sell referrals connectors](connector-salesforce.md) fundamentals and troubleshooting in three sections:

- [Fundamentals FAQ](#fundamentals-faq)
- [Configuration troubleshooting](#configuration-troubleshooting)
- [Run and maintenance troubleshooting](#run-and-maintenance-troubleshooting)

## Fundamentals FAQ

This section answers questions about the fundamentals of using co-sell referrals connectors, such as permissions, subscriptions, and setup.

##### Can I use a trial co-sell referrals connectors solution for my environment?

   Yes. You can download the connector solutions for free from [AppSource](https://appsource.microsoft.com/marketplace/apps?search=partner%20center%20referrals%20connector&page=1).

##### What role must I have to create sections in a CRM environment?

Users who are *System admins* or *System customizers* can apply changes for everyone.

All app users can personalize the system and share some of their customizations with others.

##### Do partner sellers need special roles to work on Partner Center?

Yes. Partner sellers must be assigned the *Referrals admin* role. For more information, see the [Permissions overview](create-user-accounts-and-set-permissions.md).

##### What fields should be set up first in my CRM environment?

- Make sure your *currency* setting is appropriate for your location and is in your CRM environment accurately.
- Your sales team should be listed in your CRM environment as CRM users.
  
  For more information, see [Dynamics](connector-dynamics.md) and [Salesforce](connector-salesforce.md).

##### What prerequisites are required for Power Automate environment creation?

To use the Power Automate environment, you need:

- A Power Automate license
- A minimum of 1 GB of storage

##### Do I need a Dynamics 365 subscription to use the Salesforce Connectors solution?

No. The Salesforce Connector solution that supports synchronizing with other CRM systems is of type *Dynamics Flow*. The solution doesn't require you to have a Dynamics 365 instance or a subscription.

When you install the Salesforce solution:

- A dropdown menu with the existing CDS environment in your company may appear. Select that existing CDS environment.
- If you get the error "We couldn't find a Dynamics 365 organization connected to signed-in user," create a new environment for connectors.

## Configuration troubleshooting

This section describes configuration issues that you might encounter and how to address them

##### I get the *WorkflowTriggerNotFound* error while activating flows in the Power Automate Platform

To correct a WorkflowTriggerNotFound error, use the following steps:

1. Delete the CDS connection and then recreate it.
2. Turn the child flow off and on.
3. Delete solution and reinstall it.

- Error example:

  `Error: Request to Azure Resource Manager failed with error: '{"error":{"code":"WorkflowTriggerNotFound","message":"The workflow 'e14d00f1-1fdf-4b1b-aaac-54a5064093d3' trigger 'manual' couldn't be found."}}'.`

##### I get a "Sign in" error while adding a Partner Center connector in Power Automate Platform

To fix the sign-in error, use the following steps:

1. Ensure that the user who is installing and using the connectors has the *Referrals admin* role.
2. Use your Partner Center credentials to sign in to the Power Automate environment.

##### I get a "Requiring updates" error while activating the Partner-Center-to-CRM flow in the Power Automate platform

To correct the "requiring updates" error, use the following step:

- Before you activate the Partner-Center-to-CRM flow, activate the following child flows:

##### I can't add connections to the flow when I try to edit the flow

If you can't add connections to the flow when you try to edit the flow, use the following steps:

- Add connections to the flow while the flow is running, and add to each flow separately.

- If a dialog box to add connections doesn't open automatically while editing the flow, you can edit each of the steps and substeps of the flows individually:

  - Select each flow and edit it individually.
  - Expand all the steps in the flow.

  :::image type="content" source="media/cosellconnectors/flowsteps.png" lightbox="media/cosellconnectors/flowsteps.png" alt-text="Screenshot showing steps that need connections.":::

## Run and maintenance troubleshooting

##### Power Automate flow execution failures troubleshooting

- To ensure that your Power Automate flows run as you expect, see [Fix flow failures](/power-automate/fix-flow-failures).

##### Referrals aren't synchronized properly in Partner Center or the CRM environment

To determine the status of the referral synchronization, use the following steps:

1. Select **Audit**.
2. Ensure that the following conditions are met:

   - Solution ID is provided as part of the opportunity.
   - Two-letter country code is required.
   - When help from Microsoft is selected for the opportunity, customer contact information is required.
  :::image type="content" source="media/cosellconnectors/synch.png" lightbox="media/cosellconnectors/synch.png" alt-text="Screenshot showing how to synchronize referrals.":::

##### Ensuring that a referral synchronizes bidirectionally

To ensure that a referral will synchronize bidirectionally, use the following steps:

- Ensure that the `Referral ID` field has been updated in the CRM or Partner Center.
- Ensure that users will see the success synchronize/update message in the audit field.
  - In there's a synchronization failure, the audit field gets updated with a failure message detail.
:::image type="content" source="media/cosellconnectors/enablesynch.png" lightbox="media/cosellconnectors/enablesynch.png" alt-text="Screenshot showing the confirmation that you've enabled sync.":::

##### A connector gets disconnected and I miss a referral synchronization

**You can try some of the following things:**

- Check whether the username or password has expired for the Partner Center user with Referral admin roles.
- Go to the unsynchronized opportunity, make a minor update, and check to see if the referral has synchronized.
- If the flows have run and failed, select the flow and resubmit the run that has failed.

##### I get an "Access denied" error

If you get an "Access denied" error, use the following steps:

- Make sure the appropriate roles exist:
  - *Referral administrator* role for Partner Center seller
  - *System Administrator* or *System customizer* role on your CRM instance
- Ensure that the Power Automate flow account user logs into **[Microsoft flow](<https://flow.microsoft.com>)** at least once beforehand.

##### A customer account country code is missing while creating a co-sell opportunity

- Make sure you provide the ISO two-letter country code to the customer account in the CRM (for example, "US" for United States).

##### I get a "Solution ID is required" error while creating a co-sell opportunity

- A solution is required to sync a co-sell opportunity. Make sure that your CRM has valid Microsoft co-sell-ready solutions added.

##### Co-sell opportunities are created in Partner Center, and they aren't synchronized to the CRM even though there are no flow errors

**Follow these steps:**

  1. After you've created a new co-sell deal in Partner Center, check whether Partner-Center-to-Dynamics-365 flow is invoked. (It might get invoked multiple times).
  2. If the flow gets invoked, check all invoked flows and identify the flow run that would update the CRM.
  
     You can follow the actions and verify whether it updated the CRM or encountered a problem.
  3. Check **New deal** in Partner Center to see if that gets populated with CRM ID.
  4. Make sure that the deal wasn't accidentally closed as **Won** or **Lost** in Partner Center.

##### Leads aren't synchronizing from Partner Center to Salesforce CRM or Dynamics CRM

To synchronize leads from Partner Center to Salesforce CRM or Dynamics CRM, use the following steps:

1. Go to connector solution and run the flow **Partner Center Webhook Registration (Insider Preview)** to reregister the webhook again, and make sure users select **Overwrite existing endpoints** = **Yes**.

2. After successful registration, check the synchronization again.

   :::image type="content" source="media/cosellconnectors/overwrite-trigger.png" alt-text="Screenshot showing how to overwrite the trigger.":::

- You might have multiple tenants in Partner Center, and you might need to enable a multi-tenancy setting to get leads into your CRM.
  - To check the tenants, use the following steps:

  1. Sign in to [Partner Center](https://partner.microsoft.com/dashboard/home) as a referral admin and navigate to account settings, under organization profile select tenants.

  2. If you see multiple tenants, contact the Microsoft support team to enable the multi-tenancy option for Partner Center.

     :::image type="content" source="media/cosellconnectors/settings-tenants.png" alt-text="Screenshot showing the settings for tenants.":::

##### Leads aren't synchronizing as an opportunity at Salesforce or Dynamics CRM

- If a lead *is* accepted in Partner Center, it will synchronize as an opportunity to the CRM.
- If a lead *isn't* accepted in Partner Center, it will only synchronize as a lead.
  
##### Partner Center to Dynamics Flow isn't getting triggered even after successful Webhook registration
  
To check the tenants, use the following steps:

1. Sign in to [Partner Center](https://partner.microsoft.com/dashboard/home) as a Referral admin.
2. Go to **Account settings**.
3. Under **Organization profile**, select **Tenants**.
4. If you see multiple tenants, contact the Microsoft support team to enable the multitenancy option for Partner Center.
  :::image type="content" source="media/cosellconnectors/multiple-tenants.png" alt-text="Screenshot showing multiple tenants.":::

##### Flow is getting triggered multiple times, or I can see duplicate opportunities in Dynamics CRM

- Check the opportunity audit history in Dynamics CRM to identify referrals.
  
  You must wait for up to one minute to complete synchronization before making another change and save the opportunity.

##### Installed connector solution version checking
  
You can use the following two procedures to check the installed connector solution for *Dynamics 365* or for *Salesforce*.
