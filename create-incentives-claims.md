# Create and manage an incentives co-op claim

**Appropriate roles**: Global admin | Incentives admin | Incentives user

To initiate an incentives claim, use the following steps:

1. Sign in to [Partner Center](https://partner.microsoft.com/dashboard/home) and select **Incentives**.

2. Select **Co-op management**.

   If you already have a claim in progress, the **Claims overview** page shows information about the status of existing claims, and funds approved, claimed, and totals.

3. To create a new claim, select **Create a claim**.

   After you complete the initial form and select **Create a claim**, you're taken to the Claim detail page where you can add invoices, CSRs, proof documents, and metrics. You can also add additional information if needed.

You can use the claims details to request that others in your organization upload documentation to the form. For each of the supporting documents you upload, you can provide explanatory details.

## Manage your claims

You can see all the activity that goes into the building of your claim in **History**.

Each time a colleague adds a supporting document or comments on something, that action is stored in **History**.

Feedback and requests for additional information also appear in the claim history.

Your claim's status changes as it moves through the approval process. Until you submit a claim, its status is **Editing**.

When a claim is being reviewed, you might receive feedback about an item in your proof of execution (PoE) documentation.

You can't edit your claim after you submit it unless a reviewer requests additional information.

For more information, see the [Partner Incentives Co-op Guidebook](https://assetsprod.microsoft.com/mpn/fy22-co-op-guidebook.pdf).
