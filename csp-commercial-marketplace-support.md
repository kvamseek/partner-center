# Support for commercial marketplace products in the CSP program

**Appropriate roles**: Global admin | Admin agent

Partners in the Cloud Solution Provider (CSP) program are the first point of contact for customer billing or subscription management questions related to any third-party independent software vendor (ISV) subscription or product purchased for customers from the commercial marketplace.

For technical support questions about commercial marketplace products from third-party ISV publishers, partners in the CSP program should contact the ISV publisher of that product or offer.

## Support roles of ISV products for CSP partners, ISV publishers, and Microsoft

For commercial marketplace offers or purchases of third-party ISV products or offers:

- **Support role of the ISV publisher:** ISVs provide technical support and service level commitments to their customers regarding their offer, as defined in the Third-Party Customer Agreement. The ISV should provide a way for partners in the CSP program and/or their customers to contact the ISV directly for support, including user support and break-fix support. ISVs are expected to provide partners in the CSP program with user documentation, training, and service health/outage notifications (as applicable) so those partners will be equipped to coordinate support (if partners in the CSP program choose to provide that service to their customers).

- **Support role of the partner in the CSP program:** The partner in the CSP program is responsible for all other support for third-party ISV offers. This support can relate to customers' billing questions, account set-up, and payment. The partner in the CSP program may choose to direct technical support queries from customers to the support contacts provided by the ISV publisher.

- **Support role of Microsoft:** Microsoft provides support to the third-party ISV publisher and to the partner in the CSP program regarding Microsoft commerce system functionality. This means Microsoft will be responsible for support of certain activities by the partner in the CSP program partner activities and by the ISV that occur within the Microsoft commerce system, such as onboarding/offer management, transactions, billing, account support, and deployment and provisioning for Azure-based ISV solutions.

    Microsoft doesn't provide support for commercial marketplace products offered by third-party ISV publishers. Microsoft will, however, give the partner in the  CSP program access to the ISV publisher's support contact information. Partners in the CSP program must contact the ISV publisher (above) to obtain other types of support for their offer.

In the [indirect CSP model](csp-overview.md#indirect-model), these support responsibilities are shared between the indirect provider and the indirect reseller. If you're an indirect reseller, ask your indirect provider for details.

## How to find ISV contact information

Most ISV contact details appear on the Partner Center **Offer details** page, available from the Partner Center [dashboard](https://partner.microsoft.com/dashboard/home). This includes an engineering contact for the ISV, customer support, and any CSP program contact. Information provided by the ISV here may also include user documentation, sales collateral, and a link to CSP program marketing materials.

To access the **Offer details** page, see [Discover offers in the commercial marketplace](./csp-commercial-marketplace-discover.md).
