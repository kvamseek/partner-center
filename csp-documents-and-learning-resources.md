Review the information in this article to understand the requirements for participating in Microsoft's Cloud Solution Provider (CSP) program.

## Cloud Solution Provider program authorization guide

[This guide](https://go.microsoft.com/fwlink/p/?LinkId=617100) details certain additional requirements about being a partner in the Cloud Solution Provider Program.
> [!NOTE]
> The Microsoft Partner Agreement, and specifically the Online Services and Software Channel Authorization therein, will lay out other fundamental terms and conditions for participating in the Cloud Solution Provider program.

> [!NOTE]
> If you require a business letter confirming or certifying your status as an approved Microsoft partner in the Cloud Solution Provider program, [contact support](https://partner.microsoft.com/pcv/servicerequests/create) to request one.

## Microsoft Customer Agreement customer templates

Before you can place an order on a customer's behalf, the customer must accept and sign the applicable Microsoft Customer Agreement. Microsoft Customer Agreements are region-specific. Be sure to select the correct country/region based on the customer's location.

To manually download the latest version of the Microsoft Customer Agreement template, select this [URL](https://aka.ms/customeragreement).

> [!IMPORTANT]
>You need to confirm that a customer has accepted the Microsoft Customer Agreement. You can confirm by either attesting the customer has accepted the agreement or by inviting the customer to accept the agreement directly. See [Confirm a customer's acceptance of the Microsoft Customer Agreement](confirm-customer-agreement.md).

### Professional Secrecy Amendment to the Microsoft Cloud Agreement (Germany)

In Germany, the Criminal Code (Section 203) and the professional codes of conduct require that certain client relationships are to be kept confidential, for example, the relationship between patients and their medical doctors and the relationship between attorneys and their clients. These occupational groups have to ensure professional secrecy. For these and other professions to buy cloud-based services from cloud solution providers, the cloud service provider must conclude a written agreement with the customer that ensures professional secrecy.

If you do business in Germany, you may need to provide this professional secrecy amendment to your customers there in addition to the Microsoft Cloud Agreement.

## Pricing

Download pricing details for license-based, usage-based, and one-time purchases from the **Pricing Workspace** page, available from your **Partner Center** menu.

The license-based price list is updated monthly, and Microsoft releases new pricing 30 days before it takes effect. Examples of license-based services include Office 365, Enterprise Mobility Suite, and Microsoft Dynamics CRM.

Usage-based pricing is dynamic and changes frequently. Examples of usage-based services include Microsoft Azure.

One-time purchase pricing is also dynamic. Examples of one-time purchases include Microsoft Azure reservations and corresponding subscriptions to Windows Server and SQL software.

For pricing info about ISV solutions from Microsoft's Commercial Marketplace, go to **Pricing** in the Partner Center left navigation menu, then find **Marketplace** on the **Price Lists** page. Select the country/region. Then, download the Marketplace pricing spreadsheet, which will provide info about the publisher, SKUs, and pricing. Prices for these Marketplace products can change frequently.  

## Offers

As a partner in CSP, you can sell a wide range of Microsoft products, services, and solutions, including Office 365, Enterprise Mobility Suite, Microsoft Dynamics, and Microsoft Azure. For more information about which offers are available for you to sell within these product families, see the CSP offer matrix on the **Pricing Workspace** page, available from your **Partner Center** menu. This document is updated monthly.

For CSP partners who use the Crest Usage Record API, Microsoft also publishes a list of the Azure Services in CSP on the **Pricing Workspace** page.

To learn about Azure Marketplace offers published by independent software vendors  (ISVs), visit the **Marketplace** page in the left navigation menu. Currently, only SaaS (software as a service) product types can be purchased in Partner Center. You'll need to visit the Azure portal to acquire other types of Azure Marketplace offers.
