# Apply to sell in Microsoft national clouds as part of the CSP program

**Applies to**: Partner Center for Microsoft Cloud for US Government | Partner Center for Microsoft Cloud Germany

**Appropriate roles**: Global admin

In addition to selling to customers as part of the global Cloud Solution Provider program, qualified Microsoft partners can also sell cloud solutions to customers in three separate national clouds. National clouds are physical and logical network-isolated instances of Microsoft enterprise cloud services, which are confined within the geographic borders of specific countries/regions and operated by local personnel.

For more information about Microsoft's national cloud offerings, see [Microsoft National Clouds](https://www.microsoft.com/trustcenter/cloudservices/nationalcloud).

Microsoft makes these services available in the national clouds:

- Microsoft Azure in-scope services offers hyperscale computing, storage, networking, and identity management. Azure safeguards data in the cloud at the government-required level of security, privacy, control, compliance, and transparency.

- Microsoft Dynamics 365 is a cloud-based customer relationship management (CRM) solution that equips government employees with data reporting, modeling, and workflows, while offering security features that can limit access to sensitive data.

- Microsoft Office 365 combines a defense-in-depth approach to security, rich data-protection tools, and an enterprise-grade compliance framework to provide a secure cloud-based productivity experience for government employees.

Qualified partners can sell Microsoft cloud solutions to customers in these national clouds:

## Microsoft Cloud for US Government

[**Microsoft Cloud for US Government**](https://www.microsoft.com/trustcenter/cloudservices/nationalcloud#Microsoft_Cloud_for_US) Designed for the US government from the ground up, Microsoft Cloud for Government enables public sector customers in the United States—from large federal agencies to small town governments—to select from a range of cloud computing services. To best address its customers' specific needs, Microsoft has made significant investment in datacenters and is dedicated to meeting compliance with US federal and state policies, mandates, and requirements.

For information about how to enroll in and sell to customers in Microsoft Cloud for US Government, see [Partner Center for Microsoft Cloud for US Government](partner-center-for-microsoft-us-govt-cloud.md).

## Microsoft Cloud Germany

[**Microsoft Cloud Germany**](https://www.microsoft.com/trustcenter/cloudservices/nationalcloud#Microsoft_Cloud_Germany) Microsoft Cloud Germany offers Azure, Office 365, and Dynamics 365 from German datacenters through a unique model. In this model, access to customer data is controlled by an independent German Data Trustee operating under German law. T-Systems International GmbH, a subsidiary of Deutsche Telekom, acts as the independent Data Trustee for Microsoft Cloud Germany.

> [!IMPORTANT]
> Based on the evolution in customers' needs, our cloud strategy for Germany will focus on delivery of the new cloud regions in Germany that are consistent with our global cloud offering. With this focus, we will no longer be accepting new customers or deploying any new services from the currently available Microsoft Cloud Germany. Existing customers can continue to use the current cloud services available today, which we'll maintain with necessary security updates.
>
> Moving forward, new customers have the option to use the currently available European regions or the new regions in Germany when they become available. For more information, see [Microsoft to deliver cloud services from new datacenters in Germany](https://news.microsoft.com/europe/2018/08/31/microsoft-to-deliver-cloud-services-from-new-datacentres-in-germany-in-2019-to-meet-evolving-customer-needs/).

## Azure and Office 365 operated by 21Vianet in China

Microsoft provides cloud services in China through a unique partnership with Shanghai Blue Cloud Technology Co., Ltd. (21Vianet), a wholly owned subsidiary of Beijing 21Vianet Broadband Data Center Co., Ltd. 21Vianet is the largest carrier-neutral Internet provider of datacenter, hosting, managed network, and cloud computing infrastructure services in China.

Microsoft is the technology provider, but does not operate the service; 21Vianet independently operates, provides, and manages the delivery of Microsoft cloud services. By licensing Microsoft technologies, 21Vianet can offer Azure and Office 365 services and operate Azure and Office 365 datacenters that keep data within China. 21Vianet also provides subscription and billing services, and support.
