These filters are applied at the Customers page level. Select multiple filters to render the chart for what you want to see in the **Detailed orders data** export. Filters are applied on the data extracted for the month range you selected on the upper-right corner of the page.

The page has dashboard-level filters:

- Sales Channel
- Marketplace Subscription ID
- Customer ID
- Customer Name
- Customer Company Name
- Country/region

Each filter is expandable with multiple options that you can select. Filter options are dynamic and based on the selected date range.

### Active and churned customers’ trend

This widget shows your active and churned customer trend for the selected computation period. Line chart represents the trend and you can view the value for each month by hovering over the line. The percentage value below **Active customers** in the widget represents the amount of growth during the selected computation period. For example, the following Screenshot showing a decline of 1.93% in active customers for the selected computation period.

:::image type="content" source="media/customer-dashboard/customers-widget.png" alt-text="Screenshot showing the Customers widget on the Customers page." lightbox="media/customer-dashboard/customers-widget.png" :::

There are three customer types: new, existing, and churned.

- A **new** customer has acquired one or more of your offers for the first time within the selected month.
- An **existing** customer has acquired one or more of your offers prior to the month selected.
- A **churned** customer has canceled all offers previously purchased. Churned customers for VM offers are calculated as customers who didn’t show any VM usage for two days or more. Churned customers are represented in the negative axis in the Trend widget.
