# Customer eligibility for Solutions partner

**Appropriate roles**: MPN Partner Admin | Global Admin | Executive report viewer (Organizational level)

With our goal to provide self-serve analytics to Partners, Customer Eligibility strives to provide high data fidelity and highly contextual data for the Microsoft AI Cloud Partner Program for all Solution areas metrics. It provides partners with clarity by stating the exact reasons a customer is qualified or unqualified for Solutions Partner. Using this report, you can view requirement criteria and whether a customer has met such criteria.

There are two views:

- **All Customers (Summary view):** This is a summary view of Customer Eligibility, which shares a bird's eye view of the number of customers in each metric.
- **By Customer:** This is a detailed view for a single Customer, which shows details for all metrics for all solution areas.

Below are the metrics shown to users for each solution area, respectively.

> Metrics with * have more details available for tenants/workloads (as applicable) along with customer/tenant-level information.

## How to use the report

:::image type="content" source="media/customer-eligibility/all-customers-view.png" lightbox="media/customer-eligibility/all-customers-view.png" alt-text="Screenshot of all customers view.":::

The **All customers** view shows the customer distribution for all solution areas by default. You can choose a solution area, metric or customer/tenant distribution from the dropdown and it filters for the solution area, metric or customer/tenant distribution, respectively.

In the above case, as a Partner, you're seeing the distribution of how many customers are contributing to Net Customer Adds with respective statuses. (There are 306 with growth or Positive Net Customer adds, 86 Customers who have negative net customer adds and 417 Customers who don't have any effect on Customer adds at all)

Clicking on the metric highlights the customers and details about the customers. Clicking on an individual customer opens customer details in the "By customer" view.

:::image type="content" source="media/customer-eligibility/by-customer-view.png" lightbox="media/customer-eligibility/by-customer-view.png" alt-text="Screenshot of the by customer view.":::

To enable the **By customer** view:

1. Search for any customer
2. Use the filters on the **Status** and **Solution** areas to view relevant data

**Data definitions for the visible columns:**

- The first column shows the metrics and the breakdown of the conditions used for said metric.
- Status: Met or not met based on whether the status for the metric has met the criteria.
- Criteria: Customer level criteria referring to the conditions used for the partner.
- Current Status: Shows the current attainments for the customer related to the metrics and criteria.
- Details: View details at the tenant level and workload level for the customer chosen.

### Ordering of metrics and conditions

Customer eligibility is built on the condition sequence tree for each program.

The order of the metrics is arranged in the following way:

- It checks for data if the customer is at all eligible for the program.

- It shows the eligibility for the respective metrics.

The data at the tenant level is shown in the **View details** panel available against the leaf nodes of the condition sequence tree.

The diagram below represents the condition sequence for all solution areas of Azure.
