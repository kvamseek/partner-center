# Customer retention dashboard

This article describes the Customer retention dashboard in Partner Center. This dashboard displays information about your retained customers, including offer performance, valuable customers, and monthly cohort views, all presented in a graphical and downloadable format. It is currently only available for virtual machine offers.

The following illustration shows the offer usage timeline of two customers and introduces the concept of retention days (Day 0, Day 1, … Day _n_). Retention day is a normalized concept, meaning customer 1 can start their usage journey on Jan 1st (absolute date) and customer 2 can start theirs on March 1st (absolute date). Still, each specific date will be referred to as normalized "Day 0" for both customer 1 and 2. The same convention is extended to other customers. The following image illustrates customer offer usage across time:

> [!NOTE]
> This feature is currently only available for virtual machine offers. It includes data for both trial and paid VM offers. Filters to perform retention analysis on trial and paid customers will be available in the dashboard by June 2022.

The dashboard uses the 18 months of data prior to the current system date to plot different widgets and a monthly cohort view. The raw data for these widgets can also be downloaded or accessed via programmatic API access.

:::image type="content" source="media/customer-retention-dashboard/days-weeks-months.png" alt-text="Shows the selection headings of Days, Weeks, and Months.":::

### Retained customers

Customer offer usage data is considered for a time range of 45 days to 18 months prior to the current day.

### Offer performance by category

This section shows the performance of a selected offer compared to other offers within the same selected category in the list. It compares retention scores of offers at day 45 within a category and assigns a rank. Offers with higher retention scores are ranked higher than other offers. If any retention scores match, customer count at Day 0 breaks the tie.

The left portion of the widget contains information on the current rank, offer rank based on the time granularity selected (day, week, month), and change in offer rank based on the last data refresh. **Total offers** shows the count of all offers under the selected category, including offers from all partners in the marketplace with an offer listed under the selected category. **Total customers** indicates the count of all customers of these total offers.

The right portion of the widget plots a line between the offer count on the Y-axis against retention score (at day 45) separate intervals on the X-axis. The following example shows how to read offer performance by category widget.

**Example** – If you select **Contoso test offer** listed under the **Storage** category, the offer is currently ranked 125 among a total of 608 marketplace offers in the storage category. Your offer has a retention score of 0.4 calculated on day 45 of customers using **Contoso test offer**, meaning your selected offer would retain only 40% of customers who used this offer in the last 18 months. The retention score for all marketplace offers under the **Storage** category has an average score of 0.19 and a median score of 0.10.

The offer rank, indicating the relative offer performance, has slipped by 9 ranks since the last data refresh happened for all partners in the marketplace. Hovering over the line graph shows the **Offer count**: the number of marketplace offers at different retention scores on the x-axis. In this example, **72 offers** have a retention score of **0.2**. The total offers (**608**) is the sum of all the offer counts (**Y-axis**) on the line graph at different retention score intervals (**X-axis**).

#### Weekly level analysis

:::image type="content" source="media/customer-retention-dashboard/weekly-level-analysis-example.png" alt-text="Shows the weekly analysis for a sample offer.":::

> [!NOTE]
