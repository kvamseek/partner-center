# How CSP program partners can sell subscriptions to customers

**Appropriate roles**: Admin agent | Global admin | Helpdesk agent | Sales agent

As a Cloud Solution Provider (CSP) partner, one of the central things you do is offer subscriptions for Microsoft products to your customers. In Partner Center, you can manage all your subscriptions for each customer. You can add subscriptions, add licenses to existing subscriptions, even offer trial subscriptions to customers who want to test drive the software. In addition, you can view analytics to understand how your customers are using the software, helping you to provide better support.
