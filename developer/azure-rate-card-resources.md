# Azure rate card resources to get real-time, current Azure prices on Azure offers in your region

**Applies to**: Partner Center |  Partner Center for Microsoft Cloud for US Government

The Azure Rate Card provides real-time prices for Azure offers. Azure pricing is dynamic and changes frequently. Microsoft publishes updates on Partner Center, but the REST API provides the fastest way for Cloud Solution Provider partners to get current prices.

To track usage and help predict your monthly bill and the bills for individual customers, you can combine a Rate Card query to [Get prices for Microsoft Azure](get-prices-for-microsoft-azure.md) with a request to [Get a customer's utilization records for Azure](get-a-customer-s-utilization-record-for-azure.md).

Prices differ by market and currency, and this API takes location into consideration. By default, the API uses your partner profile settings in Partner Center and your browser language, and those settings are customizable. The location awareness is especially relevant if you manage sales in multiple markets from a single, centralized office.
