# Azure utilization record resources

**Applies to**: Partner Center |  Partner Center for Microsoft Cloud for US Government

The Azure utilization record contains details about the utilization of an Azure subscription resource. If you are a cloud service provider partner who owns the billing relationship for your customers' Azure subscriptions, you can use this REST API to provide a scalable way to track usage incurred on the subscriptions in order to send an invoice to your customers at the end of every billing cycle.

To track usage and help predict your monthly bill and the bills for individual customers, you can combine a Rate Card query to [Get prices for Microsoft Azure](get-prices-for-microsoft-azure.md) with a request to [Get a customer's utilization records for Azure](get-a-customer-s-utilization-record-for-azure.md).

Prices differ by market and currency, and this API takes location into consideration. By default, the API uses your partner profile settings in Partner Center and your browser language, and those settings are customizable. The location awareness is especially relevant if you manage sales in multiple markets from a single, centralized office.
