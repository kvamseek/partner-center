# Delete a user account for a customer

This article explains how to delete an existing user account for a customer.

## Prerequisites

- Credentials as described in [Partner Center authentication](partner-center-authentication.md). This scenario supports authentication with App+User credentials only.

- A customer ID (`customer-tenant-id`). If you don't know the customer's ID, you can look it up in [Partner Center](https://partner.microsoft.com/dashboard) by selecting the **Customers** workspace, then the customer from the customer list, then **Account**. On the customer's Account page, look for the **Microsoft ID** in the **Customer Account Info** section. The Microsoft ID is the same as the customer ID  (`customer-tenant-id`).

- A user ID. If you do not have the user ID, see [Get a list of all user accounts for a customer](get-a-list-of-all-user-accounts-for-a-customer.md).

## Deleting a user account

When you delete a user account, the user state is set to **inactive** for 30 days. After thirty 30 days, the user account and its associated data are purged and made unrecoverable.

You can [restore a deleted user account for a customer](restore-a-user-for-a-customer.md) if the inactive account is within the 30-day window. However, when you restore an account that was deleted and marked as inactive, the account is no longer returned as a member of the user collection (for example, when you [get a list of all user accounts for a customer](get-a-list-of-all-user-accounts-for-a-customer.md)).

## GDAP roles

You'll need the following GDAP role:

- User Administrator

## C\#

To delete an existing customer user account:

1. Use the [**IAggregatePartner.Customers.ById**](/dotnet/api/microsoft.store.partnercenter.customers.icustomercollection.byid) method with the customer ID to identify the customer.

2. Call the [**Users.ById**](/dotnet/api/microsoft.store.partnercenter.customerusers.icustomerusercollection.byid) method to identify the user.

3. Call the [**Delete**](/dotnet/api/microsoft.store.partnercenter.customerusers.icustomeruser.delete) method to delete the user and set the user state to inactive.

``` csharp
// IAggregatePartner partnerOperations;
// string selectedCustomerId;
// string customerUserIdToDelete;

partnerOperations.Customers.ById(selectedCustomerId).Users.ById(customerUserIdToDelete).Delete();
```

**Sample**: [Console test app](console-test-app.md). **Project**: Partner Center SDK Samples **Class**: DeleteCustomerUser.cs
