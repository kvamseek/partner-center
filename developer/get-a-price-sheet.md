# Get a price sheet

This article explains how to get a price sheet for a given market and view. This method supports filters to get history by month.

## Prerequisites

- Credentials as described in [Partner API authentication](partner-center-authentication.md). This scenario only supports application user authentication. Application-only isn't yet supported. Partners that experience **http error:400** should consult the [Partner API authentication](partner-center-authentication.md) documentation.
- This API currently supports only user access where partners must be in one of the following roles: Global Admin, Admin Agent or Sales Agent.

## Details

- Current returns data only for Azure plan consumption and reservations, Licensed based (new commerce experience), and Marketplace products.
- Current pricing includes all meters and products available during the current month to the date the API is called. Previous months include all meters and products available for the given month.
- Consumption meter prices are only in USD, partners are to use the foreign exchange rates API to calculate local currency costs.
- Consumption meter prices are estimated retail prices. Partner discounts are available via [partner earned credit](../partner-earned-credit-explanation.md).
- Reservations meter prices include the CSP partner discounts. Estimated retail prices for reservations can be found in the reservations shared services downloadable from the Partner Center "Pricing and offers" page.
- More information about Azure plan pricing can be found in the [Azure plan pricing documentation](../azure-plan-price-list.md).
- Partner pricing and foreign exchange rate APIs aren't part of the [Partner Center SDK](get-started.md).
- This method returns the price list as a file stream. File stream is either a .csv file or a zip compressed version of the .csv. Details about how to request compressed files are included below.

### Response success and error codes

Each response comes with an HTTP status code that indicates success or failure and other debugging information. Use a network trace tool to read this code, error type, and other parameters. For the full list, see [Error Codes](error-codes.md).

If there are no changes expected for the new commerce licensed-based future price list, there will be no future price list returned. When passing future into the Timeline requested for the updatedlicensebased PriceSheetView, partners will see the following API response code:  404 Not Found.
