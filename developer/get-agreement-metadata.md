### Request syntax

| Method | Request URI                                                         |

## REST response

### Response success and error codes

Each response comes with an HTTP status code that indicates success or failure and additional debugging information. Use a network trace tool to read this code, error type, and additional parameters. For the full list, see [Partner Center REST error codes](error-codes.md).

### Response example

```http

MS-RequestId: 94e4e214-6b06-4fb7-96d1-94d559f9b47f
MS-CorrelationId: ab993325-1605-4cf4-bac4-fb584142a31b

    "totalCount": 1,
    "items": [
        {
            "templateId": "998b88de-aa99-4388-a42c-1b3517d49490",
            "agreementType": "MicrosoftCloudAgreement",
            "agreementLink": "https://learn.microsoft.com/partner-center/agreements",
            "versionRank": 0
        }
    ],
    "links": {
        "self": {
            "uri": "/agreements",
            "method": "GET",
            "headers": []
        }
    },
    "attributes": {
        "objectType": "Collection"
    }
}
```

To identify the resource in the response that corresponds to the Microsoft Cloud Agreement, look for the resource whose **agreementType** property has value "MicrosoftCloudAgreement".
