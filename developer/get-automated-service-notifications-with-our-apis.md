# Get automated service notifications through APIs

**Appropriate roles**: Admin agent | Global admin | Sales agent | Helpdesk agent

Office 365 and Microsoft Azure each provide an API that partners can use to retrieve real-time service health, message center communications, and planned maintenance events. These APIs are publicly available, and partners can use them on behalf of their customers because of their delegated admin privileges.

The following APIs are available:

- [Office 365 service communications API](/office/office-365-management-api/office-365-service-communications-api-reference)
- Azure Insights REST [API reference](/rest/api/monitor/)
