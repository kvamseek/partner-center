# Get confirmation of customer acceptance of Microsoft Cloud Agreement

**Applies to**: Partner Center

**Does not apply to**: Partner Center operated by 21Vianet |  Partner Center for Microsoft Cloud for US Government

The **Agreement** resource is currently supported by Partner Center only in the Microsoft public cloud.

## Prerequisites

- If you are using the Partner Center .NET SDK, version 1.9 or newer is required.

  > [!IMPORTANT]
  > As of June 2023, the latest Partner Center .NET SDK release 3.4.0 is now archived. You can [download the SDK release from GitHub](https://github.com/microsoft/partner-center-sdk-for-dotNET), along with a [readme file](https://github.com/microsoft/partner-center-sdk-for-dotNET#readme) that contains useful information.
  >
  > Partners are encouraged to continue to use the [Partner Center REST APIs](partner-center-rest-api-reference.md).

- If you are using the Partner Center Java SDK, version 1.8 or newer is required.

- Credentials as described in [Partner Center authentication](./partner-center-authentication.md). This scenario only supports app + user authentication.

- A customer ID (`customer-tenant-id`). If you don't know the customer's ID, you can look it up in [Partner Center](https://partner.microsoft.com/dashboard) by selecting the **Customers** workspace, then the customer from the customer list, then **Account**. On the customer's Account page, look for the **Microsoft ID** in the **Customer Account Info** section. The Microsoft ID is the same as the customer ID  (`customer-tenant-id`).

## .NET (version 1.4 or newer)

To retrieve confirmation(s) of customer acceptance that was previously provided:

- Use the **IAggregatePartner.Customers** collection and call **ById** method with the specified customer identifier.

- Fetch the **Agreements** property and filter the results to Microsoft Cloud Agreement by calling **ByAgreementType** method.

- Call **Get** or **GetAsync** method.

```csharp
// IAggregatePartner partnerOperations;
// string selectedCustomerId;

string agreementType = "MicrosoftCloudAgreement";

var cloudAgreements = partnerOperations.Customers.ById(selectedCustomerId).Agreements.ByAgreementType(agreementType).Get();
```

A complete sample can be found in the [GetCustomerAgreements](https://github.com/PartnerCenterSamples/Partner-Center-SDK-Samples/blob/master/Source/Partner%20Center%20SDK%20Samples/Agreements/GetCustomerAgreements.cs) class from the [console test app](https://github.com/PartnerCenterSamples/Partner-Center-SDK-Samples) project.

## .NET (version 1.9 - 1.13)

To retrieve confirmation of customer acceptance provided previously:

Use the **IAggregatePartner.Customers** collection and call the **ById** method with the specified customer's identifier. Then, get the **Agreements** property, followed by calling the **Get** or **GetAsync** methods.

```csharp
// IAggregatePartner partnerOperations;
// string selectedCustomerId;

var agreements = partnerOperations.Customers.ById(selectedCustomerId).Agreements.Get();
```

## Java

[!INCLUDE [Partner Center Java SDK support details](./includes/java-sdk-support.md)]

To retrieve confirmation of customer acceptance provided previously:

Use the **IAggregatePartner.getCustomers** function and call the **byId** function with the specified customer's identifier. Then, get the **getAgreements** function, followed by calling the **get** function.

```java
// IAggregatePartner partnerOperations;
// String selectedCustomerId;

ResourceCollection<Agreement> agreements = partnerOperations.getCustomers().byId(selectedCustomerId).getAgreements().get();
```
