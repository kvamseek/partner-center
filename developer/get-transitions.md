# Get transitions

**Applies To**

- Partner Center

**Appropriate roles**

- Global admin
- Admin agent

> [!Note] 
> The new commerce experiences for license-based services include many new capabilities and are available to all Cloud Solution Provider (CSPs). For more information, see [new commerce experiences overview](../new-commerce-license-based.md).

Used to get the history of transitions for a given customer and subscription. History includes all events that were processed for the transition. This only supports new commerce license-based subscription transitions.

## Prerequisites

- Credentials as described in [Partner Center authentication](partner-center-authentication.md). This scenario supports authentication with both standalone App and App+User credentials.

- A customer ID (`customer-tenant-id`). If you don't know the customer's ID, you can look it up in [Partner Center](https://partner.microsoft.com/dashboard) by selecting the **Customers** workspace, then the customer from the customer list, then **Account**. On the customerâ€™s Account page, look for the **Microsoft ID** in the **Customer Account Info** section. The Microsoft ID is the same as the customer ID  (`customer-tenant-id`).

- One subscription ID for the transitioned subscription.

[GET] customers/{customer-tenant-id}/subscriptions/{subscription-id}/transitions
