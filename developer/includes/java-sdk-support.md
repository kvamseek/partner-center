The [Partner Center Java SDK](https://github.com/microsoft/partner-center-java) can be used to manage Partner Center resources. It's an open-source project maintained by the partner community and not officially supported by Microsoft. You can [get help from the community](https://stackoverflow.com/questions/tagged/partner+center) or [open an issue on GitHub](https://github.com/microsoft/partner-center-java/issues) if you experience a problem.
