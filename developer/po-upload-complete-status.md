# Get purchase order upload complete status

**Appropriate roles**: Global admin | Admin agent

Partners may be required to provide Customer Purchase Order and/or Tender or Request for Proposal (RFP) information to complete a transaction within Partner Center. This article describes how partners can use Partner Center to programmatically get purchase orders statuses.  

## Prerequisites

- Credentials as described in [Partner Center authentication](partner-center-authentication.md). This scenario supports authentication with both standalone App and App+User credentials.

## REST response

Once a Partner has uploaded the Customer Purchase order and/or Tender document, Get Order details can be called to see the status change to `po_upload_complete`.

### Response success and error codes

Each response comes with an HTTP status code that indicates success or failure and more debugging information. Use a network trace tool to read this code, error type, and more parameters. For the full list, see [Error Codes](error-codes.md).
