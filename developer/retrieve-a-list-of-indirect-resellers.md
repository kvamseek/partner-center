# Retrieve a list of indirect resellers

How to retrieve a list of the signed-in partner's indirect resellers.

## Prerequisites

- Credentials as described in [Partner Center authentication](partner-center-authentication.md). This scenario supports authentication with App+User credentials only.

## C\#

To retrieve a list of indirect resellers with whom the signed-in partner has a relationship, first get an interface to relationship collection operations from the [**partnerOperations.Relationships**](/dotnet/api/microsoft.store.partnercenter.ipartner.relationships) property. Then call the [**Get**](/dotnet/api/microsoft.store.partnercenter.relationships.irelationshipcollection.get) or [**Get\_Async**](/dotnet/api/microsoft.store.partnercenter.relationships.irelationshipcollection.getasync) method, passing a member of the [**PartnerRelationshipType**](/dotnet/api/microsoft.store.partnercenter.models.relationships.partnerrelationshiptype) enumeration to identify the relationship type. To retrieve indirect resellers, you must use IsIndirectCloudSolutionProviderOf.

``` csharp
// IAggregatePartner partnerOperations;

var indirectResellers = partnerOperations.Relationships.Get(PartnerRelationshipType.IsIndirectCloudSolutionProviderOf);
```

**Sample**: [Console test app](console-test-app.md)**Project**: Partner Center SDK Samples **Class**: GetIndirectResellers.cs
