# Sandbox capabilities for Reseller relationship

**Applies to**: Partner Center | Partner Center operated by 21Vianet |  Partner Center for Microsoft Cloud for US Government

This article explains what is supported in the Sandbox for reseller relationships between the partner and the customer. 

## Prerequisites

- Partner Center account credentials. The sandbox scenario supports authentication with both the standalone App and App+User credentials.
- A customer ID (customer-tenant-id). If you don't know the customer's ID, you can look it up in [Partner Center](https://partner.microsoft.com/dashboard/home). Select the **Customers** workspace from the Partner Center menu. Select the customer from the customer list, then select **Account**. On the customer’s Account page, look for the **Microsoft ID** in the **Customer Account Info** section. The Microsoft ID is the same as the customer ID (customer-tenant-id).
- All Azure Reserved Virtual Machine Instances and software purchase orders must be canceled before deleting a customer from the Tip integration sandbox.
