# Validate an address

**Applies to**: Partner Center | Partner Center operated by 21Vianet |  Partner Center for Microsoft Cloud for US Government

How to validate an address using the address validation API.

The address validation API should only be used for pre-validation of customer profile updates. Use it with the understanding that if the country/region is the United States, Canada, China, or Mexico, the state field is validated against a list of valid states for the respective country/region. In all other countries, this test does not occur, and the API only checks that the state is a valid string.

## Prerequisites

Credentials as described in [Partner Center authentication](partner-center-authentication.md). This scenario supports authentication with both standalone App and App+User credentials.

## C\#

To validate an address, first instantiate a new **Address** object and populate it with the address to validate. Then, retrieve an interface to **Validations** operations from the **IAggregatePartner.Validations** property, and call the **IsAddressValid** method with the address object.

```csharp
IAggregatePartner partnerOperations;

// Create an address to validate.
Address address = new Address()
{
    AddressLine1 = "One Microsoft Way",
    City = "Redmond",
    State = "WA",
    PostalCode = "98052",
    Country = "US"
};

// Validate the address.
AddressValidationResponse result = partnerOperations.Validations.IsAddressValid(address);

// If the request completes successfully, you can inspect the response object.

// See the status of the validation.
Console.WriteLine($"Status: {addressValidationResult.Status}");

// See the validation message returned.
Console.WriteLine($"Validation Message Returned: {addressValidationResult.ValidationMessage ?? "No message returned."}");

// See the original address submitted for validation.
Console.WriteLine($"Original Address:\n{this.DisplayAddress(addressValidationResult.OriginalAddress)}");

// See the suggested addresses returned by the API, if any exist.
Console.WriteLine($"Suggested Addresses Returned: {addressValidationResult.SuggestedAddresses?.Count ?? "None."}");

if (addressValidationResult.SuggestedAddresses != null && addressValidationResult.SuggestedAddresses.Any())
{
    addressValidationResult.SuggestedAddresses.ForEach(a => Console.WriteLine(this.DisplayAddress(a)));
}

// Helper method to pretty-print an Address object.
private string DisplayAddress(Address address)
{
    StringBuilder sb = new StringBuilder();

    foreach (var property in address.GetType().GetProperties())
    {
        sb.AppendLine($"{property.Name}: {property.GetValue(address) ?? "None to Display."}");
    }

    return sb.ToString();
}
```
