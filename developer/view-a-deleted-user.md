# View deleted users for a customer

Gets a list of deleted CustomerUser resources for a customer by customer ID. You can optionally set a page size. You must supply a filter.

## Prerequisites

- Credentials as described in [Partner Center authentication](partner-center-authentication.md). This scenario supports authentication with App+User credentials only.

- A customer ID (`customer-tenant-id`). If you don't know the customer's ID, you can look it up in [Partner Center](https://partner.microsoft.com/dashboard) by selecting the **Customers** workspace, then the customer from the customer list, then **Account**. On the customerâ€™s Account page, look for the **Microsoft ID** in the **Customer Account Info** section. The Microsoft ID is the same as the customer ID  (`customer-tenant-id`).

## What happens when you delete a user account?

The user state is set to "inactive" when you delete a user account. It remains that way for 30 days, after which the user account and its associated data are purged and made unrecoverable. If you want to restore a deleted user account within the 30-day window, see [Restore a deleted user for a customer](restore-a-user-for-a-customer.md). Once deleted and marked "inactive", the user account is no longer returned as a member of the user collection (for example, using [Get a list of all user accounts for a customer](get-a-list-of-all-user-accounts-for-a-customer.md)). To get a list of deleted users that have not yet been purged, you must query for user accounts that have been set to inactive.

## C\#

To retrieve a list of deleted users, construct a query that filters for customer users whose status is set to inactive. First, create the filter by instantiating a [**SimpleFieldFilter**](/dotnet/api/microsoft.store.partnercenter.models.query.simplefieldfilter) object with the parameters as shown in the following code snippet. Then create the query using the [**BuildIndexedQuery**](/dotnet/api/microsoft.store.partnercenter.models.query.queryfactory.buildindexedquery) method. If you do not want paged results, you can use the [**BuildSimpleQuery**](/dotnet/api/microsoft.store.partnercenter.models.query.queryfactory.buildsimplequery) method instead. Next, use the [**IAggregatePartner.Customers.ById**](/dotnet/api/microsoft.store.partnercenter.customers.icustomercollection.byid) method with the customer ID to identify the customer. Finally, call the [**Query**](/dotnet/api/microsoft.store.partnercenter.customerusers.icustomerusercollection.query) method to send the request.

``` csharp
// IAggregatePartner partnerOperations;
// int customerUserPageSize;

// Create a filter for users whose status is inactive (i.e. deleted).
var filter = new SimpleFieldFilter("UserState", FieldFilterOperation.Equals, "Inactive");

// Build a paged query.
var simpleQueryWithFilter = QueryFactory.Instance.BuildIndexedQuery(customerUserPageSize, 0, filter);

// Send the request.
var customerUsers = partnerOperations.Customers.ById(selectedCustomerId).Users.Query(simpleQueryWithFilter);
```
