# Diversity business classifications and certifications - Canada

Partners can self-attest and upload relevant social impact and diversity business classifications and certifications by selecting the appropriate checkboxes in their [**Company profile**](https://partner.microsoft.com/dashboard/account/v3/companyprofile). You may select more than one applicable classification; providing this information is optional.

The information you provide may be shared with customers to support social value procurement and supplier diversity opportunities.

## Diverse-owned business classifications

The following are diverse-owned business classifications for **Canada**:

- **Indigenous-Owned Business:** A business that is at least 51% owned, managed, and controlled by one or more [Aboriginal person(s) in Canada](https://www.canada.ca/en/public-service-commission/jobs/services/gc-jobs/employment-equity.html).
- **Women-Owned Business Enterprise (WOBE):** A business that is at least 51% owned, managed, and controlled by one or more women.
- **Disability-Owned Business (DOBE):** A business that is at least 51% owned, managed, and controlled by one or more individuals with a disability.
- **Lesbian, Gay, Bisexual, Transgender, Queer, Two-spirit (LGBTQ2+)-Owned Business:** A business that is at least 51% owned, managed, and controlled by an LGBTQ2+ person or persons.

- **Visible Minority-Owned Business:** A business that is at least 51% by owned, managed, and controlled by person or persons of a [visible minority group](https://www.canada.ca/en/public-service-commission/jobs/services/gc-jobs/employment-equity.html) in Canada.

## Diverse-led business classifications

If your business does not meet the 51% diverse-owned business classifications because institutional investors own a majority of the company's equity, you may self-attest to your business being diverse-led **if the majority of** the company's board, appointers of the board, and management who control day-to-day operations meet diversity classifications. Review further details on the [diverse-led business requirement](./diversity-business-classifications-certs.md).

Partners will be required to attest that the information provided is true and accurate, adhering with the **Microsoft Partner Code of Conduct** found [here](https://www.microsoft.com/legal/compliance/anticorruption/trustworthy-representatives).

## Third-party certifications

Businesses with relevant third-party certifications may also upload valid certification documentation directly in their [**Company profile**](https://partner.microsoft.com/dashboard/account/v3/companyprofile). This information will be vetted by Microsoft. Certifications that have expired or that are within three months of the expiration date won't be accepted.

Upload only relevant documentation from third-party certification organizations. Personal identification documents won't be accepted.
