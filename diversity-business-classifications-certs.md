Microsoft's mission is to empower every person and every organization on the planet to achieve more.

Help enable inclusive economic opportunity by answering some questions about your partner organization on your company profile.

This information will be used to provide aggregated insights to develop and improve Microsoft partner programs, to personalize content for your business, and to help enable a more diverse Microsoft partner ecosystem.

The information you provide may also be shared with customers or with internal Microsoft sales agents to support social value procurement as well as supplier diversity opportunities through AppSource or referrals.

## Self-attestation in Partner Center

Partners can self-attest to relevant diversity business classifications by selecting the appropriate checkboxes in their [**Company profile**](https://partner.microsoft.com/dashboard/account/v3/companyprofile). You may select more than one applicable classification; providing this information is optional.

Through the [Standards of Business Conduct](https://www.microsoft.com/legal/compliance/default.aspx), Microsoft has established ethical business practices. Similarly, Microsoft expects our partners to embrace this commitment to integrity by complying with the **Microsoft Partner Code of Conduct** found [here](https://www.microsoft.com/legal/compliance/anticorruption/trustworthy-representatives).

## Diverse-led business classifications
