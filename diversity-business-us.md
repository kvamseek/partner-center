# Diversity business classifications and certifications - United States

Partners can self-attest and upload relevant social impact and diversity business classifications and certifications by selecting the appropriate checkboxes in their [**Company profile**](https://partner.microsoft.com/dashboard/account/v3/companyprofile). You may select more than one applicable classification; providing this information is optional.

The information you provide may be shared with customers to support social value procurement and supplier diversity opportunities.

## Diverse-owned business classifications

The following classifications are defined as a diverse-owned business in the **United States:**

- **Minority-Owned Business Enterprise (MBE):** A minority-owned business (may be large or small) is defined as a business that is **owned, managed, and controlled 51% or more** by one or more persons who identify with one or more of the following ethnic/racial categories: African American or Black, Asian, Hispanic or Latino, Middle Eastern or North African, Native Hawaiian or Pacific Islander, Native American or Alaska Native.
- **Women-Owned Business Enterprise (WBE):** A woman-owned business (may be large or small) is defined as a business that is **owned, managed, and controlled 51%** or more by one or more women.
- **Veteran-Owned Business Enterprise (VBE):** A veteran-owned business (may be large or small) is defined as a business that is **owned, managed, and controlled 51% or more** by one or more veterans.
- **Disability-Owned Business Enterprise (DOBE):** A business that is **at least 51% owned, managed, and controlled** by one or more individuals with a disability.
- **Lesbian, Gay, Bisexual, Transgender, Queer (LGBTQ)-Owned Business Enterprise:** A LGBTQ-owned business is defined as a business that is **at least 51% owned, operated, managed, and controlled** by an LGBTQ person or persons.

## Diverse-led business classifications

If your business does not meet the 51% diverse-owned business classifications because institutional investors own a majority of the company's equity, you may self-attest to your business being diverse-led if the majority of the company's board, appointers of the board, and management who control day-to-day operations meet diversity classifications.

Review further details on the [diverse-led business requirement](./diversity-business-classifications-certs.md).

## Third-party certifications

US businesses with relevant third-party certifications may also upload valid certification documentation directly in [**Company profile**](https://partner.microsoft.com/dashboard/account/v3/companyprofile). This information will be vetted by Microsoft. Certifications that have expired or that are within three months of the expiration date won't be accepted.

Upload only relevant documentation from third-party certification organizations. Personal identification documents won't be accepted.
