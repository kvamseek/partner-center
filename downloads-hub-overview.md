## All reports

This section is for downloading reports. It's highly flexible in terms of how users interact with the data. The main functions of this section are:

- **Favorites**: All templates, which are added as Favorites, appear in this section.
- **Reports**: You can find all the reports available for download here, and the ones scheduled (coming soon) or running in the list. The reports table has the following details for each report.
  - **Report name**: Shows the user the defined name or the default name based on the report type for the unique identification of the report.
  - **Report type**: Shows the data source selected during the report creation.
  - **Status**/Actions: Shows the status of the download. These statuses can be running,  prepared for download, or it can be a download link when the report is ready for download.
  - **Columns included**: Shows the list of columns selected for download.
  - **Time range**: Shows the time range for which the report is generated. If you don't choose a predefined format, this field shows a custom format.
  - **Generation timestamp (UTC)**: Shows the exact time and date (in UTC) when the report was generated.

Reports generated during the previous 14 days are available for download.

> [!NOTE]
> You can download reports for two years at a time and the date selection can't be more than the previous three years.
>
> For example, if you want to download data from January 2020 to January 2023, you canâ€™t download the three year report at once. You have to download two reports with different timelines and combine the data after. One report can be January 2020 to January 2021 and the second report can be January 2021 to January 2023 (a two year time range is the maximum).

### Open a report in Excel that includes non-English character sets

To open a report that includes non-English character sets, for example, Simplified Chinese, import the report into Excel using either the generic Unicode UTF-8 code identifer, **65001**, or use a specific [Unicode code page identifier](/windows/win32/intl/code-page-identifiers) for your language. Don't convert the .csv file to the Excel file format (.xlsx), because the conversion can cause data loss or garbled output. Sample instructions for the Excel for Microsoft 365:

1. Save the exported file as a .csv file.
1. Open Excel.
1. On the **Data** tab, select **Get Data** > **From File** > From **Text/CSV**.
1. Browse to the .csv report file.
1. Change the **File Origin** to **65001 UTF** (or a Unicode code page identifier).
1. Change the **Delimiter** to **Comma**.
1. Select **Load**.

The report should show correctly.
