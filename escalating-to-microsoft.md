# Escalate customer service problems to Microsoft or report vulnerabilities

**Appropriate roles**: Admin agent | Global admin | Sales agent | Helpdesk agent

If you're unable to resolve an issue, you can escalate it to Microsoft in the following ways:

- Commercial issue support: Support is available to all partners in the CSP program.
- Technical issue support: For information about specific support plans, see the following table. For more information, see [compare partner support plans](https://partner.microsoft.com/support/partnersupport).
