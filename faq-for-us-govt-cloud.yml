      - question: |
          What is Microsoft Cloud for US Government?
        answer: |
          Designed for the US government from the ground up, Microsoft Cloud for US Government enables public sector customers in the United States—from large federal agencies to small town governments—to select from a range of cloud computing services. To address customers' specific needs, Microsoft has made significant investment in data centers and is dedicated to meeting compliance with US federal and state policies, mandates, and requirements.

          Partners in the United States who serve US Federal, state, and local government entities in their governmental capacities are eligible for the CSP program for Microsoft Cloud for US Government. Microsoft has a strict validation program to determine eligibility before partners can access Microsoft Cloud for US Government. To qualify, you need to prove that you work with government customers.

      - question: |

      - question: |
          CSP Commercial is an existing partner program. How is the CSP program for Microsoft Government cloud different?
        answer: |
          The CSP program for Microsoft Cloud for US Government is different than CSP Commercial in the following areas:

          - Eligibility: The CSP program for Microsoft Cloud for US Government is available only to partners in United States that serve US Federal, state, and local government entities in their governmental capacities. Microsoft has a validation program to determine eligibility before partners can access the US Government cloud.

          - Onboarding: Partners need to onboard to the CSP program for Microsoft Cloud for US Government separately from CSP Commercial.

          - Product availability: Both Azure Government and license-based services like Office 365,  Enterprise Mobility + Security, and Dynamics 365 are available in the CSP program for Microsoft Cloud for US Government.

          - Contracting: The Microsoft Cloud Reseller Agreement (MCRA) has been updated to reflect unique government terms.

          - Partner Center functionality: Certain features of Partner Center will not be enabled for the CSP program for Microsoft Cloud for US Government to meet regulatory and compliance requirements. Partners can instead use Azure Active Directory (Azure AD) or [Graph API](/partner-center/develop/developing-for-partner-center-for-microsoft-national-cloud#partner_center_msftcloudUS) to perform tasks related to user and group management. The automated Relationship request feature is targeted to be made available by October 2021.

      - question: |
          I am not a CSP partner yet. Where can I find more information on how to become a CSP partner?
        answer: |

      - question: |
          How does licensing work?
        answer: |
          *Microsoft Cloud Reseller Agreement (MCRA)*

          The MCRA authorizes partners to resell using CSP. The US Government Cloud version of this agreement is accepted when onboarding to Microsoft Cloud for US Government. This version has a US Government Cloud Addendum and Exhibit A after the standard Cloud Reseller Agreement.

          MCRA for Microsoft Cloud for US Government is different from the standard MCRA in the following two ways:

          - US Government Cloud Addendum contains additional partner responsibility for transacting US Government Cloud services.

          - Exhibit A contains the Microsoft Customer Agreement (Microsoft Customer Agreement) that must be incorporated into every contract for US Government Cloud services entered into between the CSP and its customer.

          *Microsoft Customer Agreement (Microsoft Customer Agreement) presented as Exhibit A in MCRA*

          CSPs are required to incorporate Exhibit A in the government Contract entered between CSPs and customers purchasing Microsoft Cloud for US Government. The agreement is published on the Partner Center, and is available in English.

          Microsoft Customer Agreement for US Government Cloud is different from the standard Microsoft Customer Agreement in the following two ways:

          - It is required to be incorporated into the CSP's contract with its customer.

          - It has been tailored to comply with federal, state, and local laws and regulations.

          *Microsoft Cloud Distributor Agreement (MCDA)*

          The Microsoft Cloud Distributor Agreement (MCDA) authorizes distributors to sell via CSP. The US Government Cloud version of the MCDA has a US Government Cloud Addendum and Exhibit A after the standard Microsoft Cloud Reseller Agreement (MCRA).

          MCDA for Microsoft Cloud for US Government is different from the standard MCDA in the following two ways:

          - Microsoft Cloud for US Government Addendum contains additional partner responsibility for transacting US Government Cloud services.

          - Exhibit A contains Microsoft Customer Agreement (Microsoft Customer Agreement) that needs to be incorporated into every contract for US Government Cloud services entered into between the CSP and its customers.

If a customer or partner has Azure, they will be responsible for any data moves into a new environment within Microsoft Cloud for US Government.

      - question: |
          What is Microsoft Cloud for US Government for Azure?
        answer: |
          Azure Government cloud delivers a cloud platform built upon the foundational principles of security, privacy and control, compliance, and transparency. Public Sector entities receive a physically isolated instance of Microsoft Azure that employs world-class security and compliance services critical to US government for all systems and applications built on its architecture. These services include FedRAMP and DoD compliance certifications, CJIS state-level agreements, the ability to issue HIPAA Business Associate Agreements, and support for IRS 1075. Operated by screened US persons, Azure Government supports multiple hybrid scenarios for building and deploying solutions on-premises or in the cloud. Public Sector entities can also take advantage of the instant scalability and guaranteed uptime of a hyper-scale cloud service.

      - question: |

The roadmap is updated on an ongoing basis and we provide documentation similar to documentation for CSP Commercial within Partner Center (authentication required).
