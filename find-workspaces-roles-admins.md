#Customer intent: As a Partner Center user, I want to be able to find which workspaces and roles I have been assigned so that I can understand what I can see in Partner Center and what I can do. I also want to know who my admins are so I can request changes to my permissions when needed.

# Find your workspaces, roles, and admins

**Appropriate roles**: All Partner Center users

In Partner Center:

- *Workspaces* are groupings of tasks and information.
- *Roles* determine the workspaces that you can access.
- *Admins* assign your roles.

## Find your workspaces

Use **My access** to find your organization's workspaces and which of them you have access to.

To find your organization's workspaces, the workspaces that you have access to, and to request access to a workspace:

1. Sign in to [Partner Center](https://partner.microsoft.com/dashboard/home) and select **My access** to display a list of your organization's workspaces.

1. In the list that appears, view the workspaces and which of those workspaces you have been granted access to.

   If a workspace you're trying to access isn't listed, that means your organization isn't enrolled in the corresponding program. You can explore programs offered by Partner Center in **Account settings | Programs**.

1. Selecting a workspace in the list displays the admin to contact to request access to a workspace, and other useful information.

## Find your admins
