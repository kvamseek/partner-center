# Customer-led termination of a GDAP relationship

**Appropriate roles**: Admin agent

Your customer may decide to remove your granular delegated admin privileges (GDAP) from their tenant. Customers manage rights and permissions to their Microsoft 365 accounts on the **Partner relationships** page in the [Microsoft 365 Admin Center](https://go.microsoft.com/fwlink/p/?linkid=2024339). On this page, customers can:

- see which partners they have a relationship with, and which partners have GDAP
- remove a partner's GDAP from the tenant

## Terminate a granular admin relationship with a partner

1. On the **Partner relationships** page, the customer should select the partner of interest.
2. The customer should next select **Remove roles**.

After termination, users who were members of the security group mapped to this relationship will no longer have access to administer services.
