# Expiration of GDAP relationships

**Appropriate roles**: Admin agent

The granular delegated admin privileges (GDAP) relationship automatically expires when the duration requested in the [GDAP invitation](gdap-obtain-admin-permissions-to-manage-customer.md) has passed.

## Autoexpiration reminders

 **Before expiration**, you'll receive proactive email notifications 30 days, seven days, and one day before the GDAP expiration date.
