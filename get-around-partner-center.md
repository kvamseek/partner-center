# Getting around Partner Center

**Appropriate roles**: All partners interested in Partner Center

This article introduces Partner Center, describes page elements, and helps you get familiar with the Partner Center experience.

## What is the Partner Center?

The Partner Center is a web-based, unified console that gives you access to a wide range of partner-centric activities such as membership, benefits, and account settings, all through a graphical user interface.

The Partner Center uses the concept of workspaces to group related tasks and information together to ensure that you can quickly get to and complete your work.

## Partner Center

The [Partner Center](https://partner.microsoft.com/dashboard/home) is where you can access all of your workspaces as well as account settings and support. It makes a great place to start to find any other information you're looking for.

## Workspaces

Workspaces group tasks and information into distinct areas. You can access these workspaces through the tiles on the dashboard.

The following video describes what workspaces are and how they work.
