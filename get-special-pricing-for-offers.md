Use the following steps to check your reseller qualifications (for GCC environments).

1. Sign in to [Partner Center](https://partner.microsoft.com/dashboard/home) and select **Settings** (gear). 

2. Select **Account settings**.

3. In your **Legal profile**, in the **Program info** section, look for **Reseller qualifications**.

4. If you don't see **Reseller qualifications**, you haven't yet been authorized to purchase any special offers.

## Check customer qualifications

Use the following steps to check customer qualifications:

1. From the **Partner Center** menu, select **Customers** and then choose the customer from the list.
2. In the customer menu, select **Account**.
3. In the **Company info** section, look for **Special qualifications**.
4. If **Special qualifications** is set to **None**, but the customer does in fact meet the qualifications, you can **Update** their details to include them.

## Purchase rules for special segments
