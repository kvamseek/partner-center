# Generate a marketing plan for your incentives program

**Appropriate roles**: Incentives admin | Billing admin | Global admin

A co-op claims plan is the series of marketing campaigns, activities, and other details describing how you'll make your program a success. Once you create your plan, you'll submit it to Microsoft for approval.

## Create your incentives plan

You can view your plans by selecting **Plan Management** on your **Incentives** page, and then opening the program you want.

> [!NOTE]
> You may not see Plan Management on your Incentives page. This is because the Partner Center is dynamic, and only displays what's appropriate for your specific role and activities. If you don't see Plan Management on your Incentives page, it probably means you're not currently enrolled in a program that has plans. Contact your Incentives admin for assistance.

For more information on plans for your particular Incentives program, see your program guide.

## How to submit a plan

Use the following steps to submit an incentives plan.

1. Sign in to [Partner Center](https://partner.microsoft.com/dashboard/home) and select **Incentives**.

2. Select **Program**, then locate the appropriate market for your plan, and then select **Create plan**.

3. On the **New plan** page, complete the required fields. **Currency** is the value you want to have the plan reflect. **Reviewer email** should be the Microsoft email address of your account manager. Only one plan can be created per PartnerID, fund, program, and period. Select **Save**.

4. On the plan's status page, review the information displayed. Select **Edit** to update any of the information.

5. When the information on this page is correct, select **New campaign**.

6. Complete the required fields on the **New campaign** page, and then select **Save**.

7. On the status page, select **New activity**.

8. On the **New activity** page, complete the required fields. You can select multiple countries/regions. When you're finished, select **Save**.

9. On the status page, review your information again. Once you submit a plan, you can't edit it. When you're finished, select **Submit**, and then select **Confirm**.

Your plan is now submitted. Microsoft will notify your Incentive admin when it's been approved or if we need additional information. You can view the plan's progress in the Status window of the status page.

## View the status of your plan

Use the following steps to view the status of your plan.

1. Sign in to [Partner Center](https://partner.microsoft.com/dashboard/home) and select **Incentives**.

2. Select **Plans Management** and then select the program you want.

    The status page will open.

3. In the **Plans** section, the status of each plan is listed in the **Status** column.

   The following are the various possible statuses for your co-op claim plan.

   - Submitted
   - Under review
   - Action required
   - Editing
   - Approved
   - Rejected

## Plan submission timelines

You must create and submit your plan by the last day of the program year. If necessary, you can edit and resubmit the plan for another 90 days after that, but the plan must be created and initially submitted during the program year.

> [!NOTE]
> You can only create one plan per fund type for a program year.

## Plan payments

Microsoft pays you every month based on your earnings and the limits of your plan. Payments are made on the 15th day of the following month.

For example, if your plan is approved for $10,000, and you earned $5,000 in the month of April, you'll receive $5,000 on May 15.

Under that same plan, if you earn $15,000 in the month of April, you'll receive $10,000 on May 15 because $10,000 was the limit for your plan. To receive more payment, you need to raise the limit of your plan for the next month.
