# Enroll in the incentives program and manage users

**Appropriate roles**: Incentives admin

The enrollment process consists of two steps:

- **Step 1. User management:** This step involves assigning the Incentive administrator in [Partner Center](https://partner.microsoft.com/dashboard/home).
- **Step 2. Enrollment:** Microsoft sends you an invitation to enroll in your incentive program.

## Manage users

To enroll in a Partner Center incentive program, the Global administrator or Account administrator needs to set up your company's users as Incentive administrators. For information on partner accounts, roles, and permissions, see [Manage your Partner Center account](partner-center-account-setup.md). The Global administrator can also set up your company users through the Azure Active Directory (Azure AD).

> [!NOTE]
> Only the Incentive administrator can enroll in incentive programs. If there is no Incentive administrator for your location, the Global administrator and Account administrator must assign one. The Incentive administrator must be assigned for the location PartnerIDs. The Global administrator or Account administrator can also be assigned as the Incentive administrator. To learn more about different roles, see [Manage incentives](permissions-overview.md#manage-incentives).

## Enrollment Process

Once your organization is eligible for incentives, Microsoft will send an invitation to the Incentive administrator of the eligible LocationID to begin the enrollment process. This email will be sent from **Microsoft Partner Center** and will have the subject **Partner Incentive Enrollment Invitation**. Open the invitation and select **Get Started**.

You'll also see an invitation on the Partner Center home page. Once you select that message, you won't be able to see it again. However, the Incentive administrator can still complete the process by signing in to the [Partner Center](https://partner.microsoft.com/dashboard/home) and selecting **Incentives**. Select **Enroll** and then complete the payout and tax profile for the program.

If you already have a default bank profile setup for a Microsoft AI Cloud Partner Program location and you're trying to enroll for the same Microsoft AI Cloud Partner Program location in an incentive program, when you select **Enroll** and accept the invitation, you'll see the default bank profile. You'll also be shown any available tax profile for that Microsoft AI Cloud Partner Program location. If Microsoft has all the required bank and tax profile detail, you'll be prompted to select **Submit** to complete the enrollment. See [Set up a default bank profile](incentives-create-and-manage-your-payout-and-tax-profiles.md#set-up-a-default-bank-profile).

You can also choose a bank profile other than the default bank profile. If Microsoft requires more details for the payment or tax profiles or currency, you'll be prompted to **Continue** and be redirected to the **Payment and Tax profile** page to provide the missing details.

An enrollment is considered complete only when the payout and tax profile you provide for the enrollment is validated by Microsoft.

> [!NOTE]
> Certain incentive programs have no eligibility criteria, and are open to all partners. The Incentive administrator will see invitations for these programs on the incentive overview page, provided they have permissions for the relevant incentive program and MPN. Microsoft doesn't send email invitations for these programs.

For more information on the enrollment process, download the [Incentives Enrollment Guide](https://partner.microsoft.com/resources/detail/partner-center-incentives-enrollment-pdf) (sign-in required).

## Expiration and renewal

Incentives enrollment expires at the end of the fiscal year. However, as long as you remain an eligible partner with an active agreement, Microsoft will continue your incentives enrollment into the next fiscal year. You don't need to take any action as long as the payout and tax information required for the incentive program is complete as per the rules of the incentive program.
