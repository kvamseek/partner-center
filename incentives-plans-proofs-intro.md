# Use these resources to help you create incentives plans and proofs of execution

**Appropriate roles**: Incentives admin | Incentives user

This article describes some of the key documents required for you to be successful and get paid for your work in a specific incentives program. These documents include:

- An incentives plan
- A detailed proof of execution (PoE)

Depending on the type of incentives program you're enrolled in, your plan and your proof of execution (PoE) will be instrumental to your success with incentives.

## What is an incentives plan?

An incentives plan describes the marketing campaigns, activities, and other details needed to make your program a success. Once you create this plan, you will submit it to Microsoft for approval. Learn more about [creating your plan](incentives-create-your-plan.md).

## What is a proof of execution (PoE)?

After you get paid for your incentives work, you must submit a detailed proof of execution (PoE) to Microsoft. Your PoE may include details about any related campaign, the date an incentives activity occurred, and the amount claimed.
