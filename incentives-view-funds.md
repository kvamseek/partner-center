# View available earned, claimed, and remaining co-op funds

**Appropriate roles**: Incentives admin | Incentives user

You can track, monitor, and reconcile your incentive co-op funds in the [Partner Center](https://partner.microsoft.com/dashboard/home) (sign-in required).

## View your co-op funds

To view your incentive co-op funds:

1. Sign in to [Partner Center](https://partner.microsoft.com/dashboard/home) and select **Incentives**.

2. Select **Program** and then select the appropriate incentive program from the expanded program list.

3. At the top of the program page, select **View claims**.

4. Above **Co-op claimed**, select the usage period you want to see.

   Doing so displays **Co-op earned**, **Co-op claimed**, and **Remaining co-op** for the selected period.

   The expiration date for the selected period appears below the **Remaining co-op** display.

5. Scroll to the bottom of the page to view all claims submitted for the selected period.

### Download transaction history

If you think that there are discrepancies in the amounts displayed in the summary, you can download the transaction history from the previous period. This report will help you to determine the amount of co-op funds earned for the selected usage period.

To download transaction histories, or to validate claims submitted to ensure the remaining co-op amount is accurate, see [Transaction history](transaction-history.md#transaction-history-page).

## View estimated earnings during the current period

Co-op earnings for the current earning period aren't visible in the **Co-op Management** view until after the start of the claiming period for the current earning period. However, you can view your estimated co-op earnings for the current earning period.

To view your estimated co-op earnings for the current earning period:

1. On your **Transaction history** page, select the dates for the current earning period.
2. Under the **Earning type** filter, select **Co-op**.

   Your estimated co-op earnings are displayed.

3. Select **Download** to download this data if desired.

### View co-op thresholds

If your co-op earnings are below the threshold in a co-op earning period, they don't qualify for use. Instead, you receive your co-op earnings as a rebate at the end of the semester.

To view the co-op thresholds for incentive programs, see [Co-op threshold](claims-threshold.md).

### Getting help

If you're still having trouble reconciling amounts, or if some co-op funds aren't visible, you can create a support request.

To create a support request:

- Select the question mark icon from the upper right corner of the page, and then select **Incentives**.
