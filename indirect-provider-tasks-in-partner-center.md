# Partner with indirect resellers in the Cloud Solution Provider program

**Appropriate roles**: Global admin | Sales agent

With such a complex and rapidly evolving technology marketplace, customers want the competitive edge that technology solutions can give them. In such a climate, it makes sense for partners to invest in partner-to-partner engagements to extend offerings and enable customers to do even more.

New resellers are entering the market and seeking ways to offer their solutions to customers outside of their markets and locales. As an established technology provider, you're well positioned to be their route to market.

Engage with indirect resellers in the Cloud Solution Provider (CSP) program to connect with other partners, bring new solutions to the market, and advance customers' adoption of cloud services.

In the indirect provider-reseller (two-tier) model, you work with indirect resellers to offer Microsoft cloud solutions to customers. You purchase products and subscriptions directly from Microsoft and then offer those solutions to customers through your resellers.

___

As an indirect provider, you use Partner Center to:

- Connect with indirect resellers who can help expand your reach and customer base.
- Establish partnerships with indirect resellers that allow you both to serve common customers.
- Designate indirect resellers to manage specific customers and subscriptions.
- Manage your relationships with Microsoft, customers, and indirect resellers all in one place.

For information on what's required to participate in the CSP program as an indirect reseller, see [Get started as an indirect reseller](https://partner.microsoft.com/membership/cloud-solution-provider/) on the [Microsoft AI Cloud Partner Program website](https://partner.microsoft.com).

## Establish and manage partnership with indirect resellers and customers

To establish and manage your partnership with indirect resellers and customers, use the following steps:

(Steps 2 and 3 are described in more detail in the following sections.)

1. Review your company's profile on [Microsoft's official indirect providers list](https://partner.microsoft.com/membership/cloud-solution-provider/find-a-provider).

   - To make changes to your company's indirect provider profile, contact your Microsoft representative.

2. [Connect with indirect resellers](#connect-with-indirect-resellers).

   - Before you can interact and transact with resellers, you must establish partnerships with them in Partner Center.

3. [Connect with customers](#connect-with-customers).

   - Associate new customers and subscriptions with resellers.

   - Establish reseller relationships with existing customers.

After you complete the preceding steps, you can manage your reseller partnerships on the **Indirect resellers** page from your **Partner Center** menu.

> [!IMPORTANT]
> Before you can start working with resellers, they must be enrolled as indirect resellers in the CSP program and have Partner Center accounts. Direct your resellers to [Partner with indirect providers in CSP](https://msdn.microsoft.com/partner-center/indirect-reseller-tasks-in-partner-center.md) for information about enrolling in CSP.

## Connect with indirect resellers

To interact and transact with indirect resellers in Partner Center, you must establish a partnership with them. Having a partnership with an indirect reseller allows both you and the reseller to serve common customers.

To establish a partnership, email a partnership request to the reseller. Be sure to have the reseller's email address on hand before you get started.

On the subscription details page, in the **Reseller (PartnerID) field**, add the reseller you want to work with. Be sure to use the PartnerID associated with the reseller's Partner Location Account they used to onboard to Partner Center. This action ensures that the reseller will receive the appropriate incentives and they have an active Microsoft Partner Agreement to engage in the transaction.

To request a partnership with an indirect reseller, use the following steps:

1. Select **Indirect resellers** from your **Partner Center** menu.
1. On the **Indirect resellers** page, select **Request a partnership**.

   A draft email message appears.

1. Select **Open in email** to open the message in your default email application.

   **- or -**

   Select **Copy to clipboard** to copy and then paste the message into an email.

1. Select **Done** when finished.
    > [!IMPORTANT]
    >  You can edit the text in the email message, but be sure to include the link because it's personalized for your Partner Center account.

   After the reseller accepts your partnership request, they'll appear in your indirect resellers list. Then you can:

   - Add new customers on their behalf.
   - Submit orders on behalf of their customers.
   - Associate the reseller with a subscription, so they can manage it on behalf of the customer who purchased it.
   - Designate the reseller as the customer's support contact for specific subscriptions.

### Update details of existing subscriptions to include the indirect reseller

For existing subscriptions, if you decide to work with an indirect reseller, you can update the subscription details to include the indirect reseller.

To update the details of existing subscriptions to include the indirect reseller, use the following step:

- On the subscription details page, in the **Reseller (PartnerID)** field, add the reseller you want to work with. Doing so ensures that the reseller receives the appropriate incentives and provides contact details for customers on the Microsoft 365 admin center.

  :::image type="content" source="./media/resellers/reseller-mpn-id.png" lightbox="./media/resellers/reseller-mpn-id.png" alt-text="Screenshot of the Subscriptions page, with the Renew (MPN ID) drop-down open.":::

  In the **Reseller (MPN ID)** dropdown, either:
  
  - Select an existing indirect reseller listed *or*
  - To add a different reseller, select **Indirect reseller not in the list? Enter MPN ID**. Enter the reseller's MPN ID, and select **Verify**.
  
  Select **Submit**.

### Set the level of access and involvement that you want a reseller to have

Depending on the level of access and involvement that you want the reseller to have, you might want to take one or more of the actions described in the following table.

| **To accomplish this:** | **Do this:** | **At this location:** |
|   ------------------   |   -------   |   -----   |
| Enable a reseller to manage a customer's account and have administrator permissions to manage their subscriptions. | Associate the reseller with the customer account when adding the new customer. | On the **New customer** page |
| Enable the reseller to manage an Azure customer's account. |Associate a reseller with an Azure customer account when adding a new customer.|On the **Azure service portal**, select **[User Settings](https://aad.portal.azure.com/#blade/Microsoft_AAD_IAM/UsersManagementMenuBlade/UserSettings)** to give the indirect reseller **tenant owner** permissions.|
| Give the reseller credit for incentives. | Associate the reseller with the subscription (new or existing). | On the **New subscription** page |
| Delegate customer support for specific subscriptions to the reseller. | Select the reseller from the **Designated support contact** list. | On the subscription's detail page, select the customer from your **Customers** page and then select the subscription from the customer's **Subscriptions** page. |

## Remove a partnership with an indirect reseller

To remove a partnership with an indirect reseller, use the following steps:

1. From the Partner Center menu on the dashboard, select **Indirect resellers**.
1. On the **Indirect resellers** page, select **Remove partnership**.
1. Select **Yes** when the message asking for confirmation appears.

    :::image type="content" source="media/ip-ir-relationship.png" lightbox="media/ip-ir-relationship.png" alt-text="Screenshot that highlights the Remove partnership option on the Indirect resellers page at Partner Center.":::

   > [!IMPORTANT]
   > Customers associated with the indirect reseller will not be removed. Any delegated admin privileges granted will remain unchanged.
   >
   > You represent that the decision to discontinue your relationship with partner was made in good faith, for a legitimate business purpose, and in accordance with your agreement with your customer or partner, and you agree to defend and hold Microsoft harmless from and against any third-party claims to the contrary.
   >
   > You must provide legal notice of termination to your customer or partner if your agreement requires it. This tool does not generate notice to the customer or partner.

The indirect reseller whose partnership you removed won't appear in the list. Depending on the level of access and involvement, you might want to communicate with the indirect reseller and end customer about this change.

## Connect with customers

When you get new customers, you need to create accounts for them in Partner Center. When you add a new customer account, you can designate a reseller to manage the account and administer the customers' subscriptions and services on their behalf.

When you associate a reseller with a new customer account, you're delegating account and subscription management to that reseller. This association means that the reseller has administrator access to the customer's subscriptions and services and can manage them on behalf of the customer.

### Add new customers and associate them with indirect resellers

To add new customers and associate them with indirect resellers, use the following steps:

1. Select **Indirect resellers** from your **Partner Center** menu.
1. Find the indirect reseller that you want to assign new customers with and then select **Add new customer**.

   The indirect reseller is already selected for you on the customer detail form.

1. Provide the customer's details and then select **Next: Subscriptions**.
1. On the **New subscription** page, select the subscriptions the customer wants to buy and then enter the number of licenses the customer needs.
1. Select **Next: Review**.
1. If the order is correct, select **Submit**.

   **- or -**

   If the order is incorrect, select **Cancel** to cancel the entire operation and start over.

1. After you submit the order, the **Confirmation** page appears. Under **Setup info**, the admin user account name and temporary password are displayed. Copy the user account name and password information so you can send it on to the new customer.

    > [!IMPORTANT]
    > Be sure to make a note of the user account name and password because you can't access that information again after you close the page.

1. Select **Done**.

   The new customer appears in your customer list, associated with the indirect reseller.

   The reseller now has admin access to the customer's account information and subscriptions and can manage the subscriptions on the customer's behalf.

### Add new subscriptions to customer accounts

When customers want to buy new subscriptions, upgrade existing ones, or buy more licenses, you make these changes in the customer's account through the Microsoft 365 portal. You can't perform those actions in the Azure portal.

To add new subscriptions to customer accounts, use the following steps:

1. Select **Customers** from your **Partner Center** menu.
1. Find the customer whose account you want to change.
1. Expand the customer's record by selecting the down arrow and then selecting **Add subscriptions**.
1. On the **Add new** page, select the subscriptions and enter the number of licenses the customer wants to purchase.
1. To associate the subscription with a reseller, select the reseller's name from the list and then select **Submit**.

   Associating the reseller with the subscription enables them to earn incentives, if applicable.

1. The new subscriptions appear in the customer's subscriptions list.
1. If you want the reseller to handle customer support requests for the new subscription, select the subscription, and then select the reseller from the **Designated support contact** list.
1. Select **Submit** when finished.
