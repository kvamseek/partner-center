# CPP role-based access

**Appropriate roles**: Global admin | Admin agent | Report viewer | Executive report viewer

Reports at the Insights dashboard are available only to users who have the *Executive report viewer* or *Report viewer* roles.

* *Executive report viewers* have access to all reporting datasets.
* *Report viewers* have access to all reporting datasets except those with sensitive data, such as revenue and customer/employee personal data.

A Global admin or an Account admin can assign users to these roles on the User management page. The roles can be assigned to grant access an entire organization or only to specific Microsoft AI Cloud Partner Program locations.

> [!IMPORTANT]
> *MPN Partner admins* are automatically assigned the *Executive report viewer* role for the entire organization for a tenant. <br> *Therefore, MPN Partner admins  automatically have Executive report viewer access for the entire organization without any action required by a Global admin or Account admin.* <br> However, Global admins and Account admins can override auto-assigned roles.
