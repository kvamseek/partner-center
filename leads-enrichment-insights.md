# Customer insights for marketplace leads

**Appropriate roles**: Referrals admin

Microsoft has many signals about customers visiting the marketplace, and we're sharing these customer insights with our partners. This will help you have better conversations with prospects and help you grow your business.

As a referral admin, to see customer insights, select **Insights** on the Lead details page.

In the first section, one can see the lead's contact and the company information and the company location. This includes contact validation, which indicates whether email addresses and phone numbers are valid or not. This will help your team be more effective in prioritizing leads who are contactable.

Here's an example **Insights** panel:
