# Make a payment

**Appropriate roles**: Global admin | User management admin | MPN Partner Admin | Admin agent

You can pay for Solutions Partner legacy pack or Solutions partner Action Pack with a credit card or an electronic bank transfer.

## Pay with a credit card

To pay with a credit card, use the following steps:

1. If you selected  **Credit card** as your payment method, the **Credit card details** page appears.

2. Select **Agreement** close to the top of the page, and review the *MPN Offer Purchase Terms and Conditions* on behalf of your company. This agreement has important information about your billing account, renewal, refund eligibility, and taxes.

3. On the checkout page, review and confirm your details.

   To learn more updating your company's **Tax ID** information, see [Add a VAT ID to your billing profile](organization-tax-info.md).

   To change your **Bill to or Sold to** company address, visit the Legal Business profile page by following **My Profile** > **Organization Profile** > **Company details**.

4. Enter the required information and then select **Pay**.

   > [!NOTE]
   > Your payment will be collected through a third-party, secure payment gateway.
   >
   > Your Solutions Partner legacy pack or Solutions partner Microsoft Action Pack is activated when the transaction is completed.

**Tips for successful payment with credit card.**

1. Microsoft ensures that payment of credit cards is secured and minimizes the chances of risks, frauds, or payments with stolen cards.

2. Ensure you enter your credit card billing address and ZIP code on this page. If the billing address on card is different than your legal entity address, in such a case while entering information in credit card screen please enter your billing address of credit card and not legal entity address.

3. Double payment: In case you have paid and did not receive an order confirmation and re-initiated the transaction and the transaction was successful. If you did not get any payment confirmation from Microsoft, check your bank account statement for the charges. The charges shown in the bank statement are not actual charges but authorizations on the credit card. In the case where the card is authorized and Microsoft has declined the transaction, please wait for 48 hours for the authorization to be reversed, and the held amount is released.

4. 715 error issue: If you encounter this issue and the  payment is not successful, try again after 24 hours. If after 24 hours the payment is not successful, try switching the payment method to wire transfer.

If the payment process isn't fully completed within 30 days of your order creation date, the status of your order changes to expired. If your order is expired, you'll have to create a new order from Partner Center directly, but you won't have to send payment again.

To upload your payment proof, use the following steps:

1. Sign in to the [Partner Center](https://partner.microsoft.com/dashboard/home), select the **Membership** workspace, then select **Membership offers**.
2. In the **Membership offers** page, page, go to the offer that you purchased (Microsoft Action Pack or Solutions partner legacy pack) and select **Upload payment proof**.

4. Complete the information in the other boxes related to your electronic funds transfer, such as **Payment date**, **Paid to account number**, and **Transaction/Ref no**.

   Your purchase typically becomes active between 48 and 72 hours after payment reaches Microsoft's bank account. The entire process can take up to a week to complete. Providing the necessary information in your electronic bank transfer reference details (such as, *Order number* and *PartnerID*) and uploading proof of payment to Partner Center helps get your payment processed and your Action Pack subscription activated sooner.

### Switch payment from electronic bank transfer to credit card

1. In the **Membership offers** page, select the respective card and select **Cancel Order**.  
1. Follow the remaining steps to cancel the order.
1. Refer to earlier sections of this article to create a new order with different payment preferences.
