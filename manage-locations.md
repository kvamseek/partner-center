# Manage your Microsoft AI Cloud Partner Program account locations, and add or delete a location

**Appropriate roles**: Account admin

A Microsoft AI Cloud Partner Program account can be global or local. Each Microsoft AI Cloud Partner Program account has a PartnerID.

- The *global PartnerID* identifies the equivalent of a company's headquarters. It's used for non-transactional activities such as support requests.

- A *location PartnerID* identifies a company subsidiary. It's used to enroll in incentive programs, to transact Cloud Solution Provider (CSP) business, and other business transactions. Payouts are tied to these specific locations.

## Example Microsoft AI Cloud Partner Program account structure and account IDs

In the diagram, Contoso has its company headquarters in the UK, so that's where the business is legally registered. The UK is also the location of Contoso's partner global account (PGA), PartnerID 1234566.

Contoso has subsidiaries in the UK, France, and the United States. Each has its own partner location account (PLA) and PartnerID.

> [!NOTE]
> There is a one-to-one relationship between a CSP tenant and a Microsoft AI Cloud Partner Program location ID.

3. Select **Legal** and then, on the **Partner** tab, select **Business locations** and select **Add location.**

   > [!IMPORTANT]
   >
   >- After you add a PartnerLocationID in Partner Center, you must contact Partner Support if you want to remove it. For more information about deleting a location, see the next section, [Delete a location PartnerID](#delete-a-partner-location).
   >- Ensure that the enrolling location is a legitimate business entity and at the stated address. Otherwise, the location will not pass the verification process.

## Delete a partner location

To delete a PartnerLocationID from your account, you must contact [Partner Support](https://partner.microsoft.com/dashboard/v2/support/servicerequests/create?stage=2&topicid=1af7f3a0-1757-3543-4b6a-c945c3ad187b).

Before a PartnerLocationID can be deleted, you'll be required to provide written statement saying that you understand that:

- Deleted locations can't be retrieved.
- Anything tied to that PartnerID will no longer be recognized or be active for your company (for example, co-sell solutions or other program enrollments).

## Prerequisites for adding a new account for a CSP business

To add a new CSP business account, start by ensuring that you've fulfilled the prerequisites:

- You must accept the Microsoft Partner Agreement and activate the account.

- You must have a PartnerLocationID in the country/region where you want to do CSP business.

- If you want to enroll as a direct-bill partner, read [Requirements to enroll as a CSP direct-bill partner](direct-partner-new-requirements.md)

- To create a new CSP indirect reseller enrollment, read [Work with indirect providers](indirect-reseller-tasks-in-partner-center.md#get-started).

    > [!NOTE]
    > Remember to sign in with the **new** credentials for the **new** CSP account. Don't use your existing credentials because if you do, Partner Center will recognize you as already having an account.

3. Find the PartnerID with type *Location* that matches the country/region of this CSP account and use it to complete the association.
