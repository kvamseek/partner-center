# Manage Marketplace Rewards in Partner Center, and activate marketing and sales benefits

**Appropriate roles**: MACPP Partner Admin | Global admin | Admin agent

If you publish software offers to our commercial marketplace, Marketplace Rewards (now included in ISV Success, available—at no cost—to all participants of the program) provides targeted support for all your offers with marketing, sales, and technical benefits. For details on the program and benefits, see [Marketplace Rewards](https://aka.ms/marketplacerewards) (PPT).

Marketplace Rewards eligibility is calculated based on all publisher profiles linked to the PGA Microsoft AI Cloud Partner Program company. To check your eligibility for the Marketplace Rewards program, go to the Partner Center [Marketplace Rewards page](https://partner.microsoft.com/dashboard/mpn/program/commercialmarketplace).

## Sales and marketing benefits

1. From the Partner Center [dashboard](https://partner.microsoft.com/dashboard/home), select **Sales and Marketing benefits** tab on Marketplace Rewards page to see your list of benefits.

2. To activate any sales and marketing benefit, you must first assign a company marketing contact. This contact will receive follow-up communications about your Marketplace Rewards.

3. To add or update your marketing contact information, go to the top of the Sales and Marketing benefits tab on Marketplace Rewards page, then select **Add, update, or change**.

   Next, do the following:

   - Select a user from the list. If the user you want to assign isn't in the list, you can add new users in Account settings.

   - Provide an email address for the user that's different from the email address associated with your company's Partner Center account. We'll email instructions for using your Marketplace Rewards benefit to your designated marketing contact's email address.

   - Provide the contact phone and preferred language for this marketing contact. After you finish entering this information, select **Assign user**.

4. After you've updated the marketing contact, select **Activate** for the benefit you want to start using. After you activate a benefit, your marketing contact will be contacted by a member of the Rewards team within a week.

## Why can't I see Marketplace Rewards on my dashboard?

The marketplace rewards information is available through the Microsoft Azure Active Directory (Azure AD) tenant and PartnerID that was used to create your Partner Center account. This account is called the Partner Global Account (PGA) of your company. If your Azure AD tenant is different from the one used for Microsoft AI Cloud Partner Program onboarding, you must associate it with your company's PGA to see the Commercial Rewards Marketplace menu.

### To associate an Azure AD tenant with the PGA of your company

1. As either the global admin or account admin, sign in to the PGA in Partner Center.

2. Select **Settings** (at the top-right) > **Account settings** > **Tenants**.

3. Select **Associate another Azure AD tenant** and then select the Azure AD tenant you want to associate with the PGA.

4. Add the user name and password of any user in the Azure AD tenant who you want to associate, and select **Submit**.

5. Sign out of Partner Center and then sign in using the user name and password of the tenant you associated to the PGA.

You'll now be able to see the Commercial Rewards Marketplace program information in the left navigation menu.
