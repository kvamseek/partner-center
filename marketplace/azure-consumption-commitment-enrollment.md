# Azure Consumption Commitment enrollment

This article is for commercial marketplace publishers and describes Microsoft Azure Consumption Commitment (MACC), a contractual commitment customers make with Microsoft for specific amounts of Azure spend over time. For information about how MACC benefits customers, see [Azure Consumption Commitment benefit](/marketplace/azure-consumption-commitment-benefit).

> [!TIP]
> To see the customer's view of consumption commitment benefits in Azure Marketplace, see [Azure consumption commitment benefit](/marketplace/azure-consumption-commitment-benefit).

## MACC program

The _Microsoft Azure Consumption Commitment (MACC)_ program is for [transactable offers](marketplace-commercial-transaction-capabilities-and-considerations.md#transact-overview) that are published to the commercial marketplace. Marketplace purchases of transactable offers that are enrolled in this program contribute towards an organization’s Microsoft Azure Consumption Commitment.
Marketplace purchases that contribute towards a customer’s Microsoft Azure consumption commitment are limited to Azure benefit-eligible offers and can only be used to purchase solutions that are primarily platformed on or extend Microsoft cloud products or infrastructure

### Requirements for an offer to be enrolled in MACC

An offer must meet the following requirements to be enrolled in the MACC program:

- Transactable with a pricing plan greater than $0  
    > [!NOTE]
    > Free and BYOL (bring your own license) offers are NOT considered transactable.
- Azure IP co-sell eligible
- Published live in the commercial marketplace

## How to see if your offer is enrolled in the MACC program
