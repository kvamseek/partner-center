> It's necessary to complete all the steps in this article before publishing changes to a new or existing offer.

## Set up your Microsoft Partner Center account

To set up and manage your account for ISV Success, complete the [ISV Success application form](https://www.microsoft.com/en-us/isv/success-program-application). 

## Accept the ISV Success for Business Applications Addendum

Participation in this program requires you to review and accept the [Business Applications Addendum](https://aka.ms/bizappsisvaddendum).

> [!NOTE]

1. Select **Settings** (gear icon) > **Account settings**.
1. Select **Agreements**.
1. Select the version link and view the agreement.
1. To agree and accept the agreement, select **Accept Agreement**.

    To complete this step, you must accept the ISV Success for Business Applications Addendum. If this agreement is not displayed as an option, skip to the [Publish and certify your application](#publish-and-certify-your-application) below to first create a draft offer. Then return to this step once the draft offer exists. At that time, this agreement will be presented and can be accepted. This system requires that this step be completed prior to submission of the draft offer for certification.

## Set up your billing information

Set up billing information for ISV Success for Business Applications.

> [!NOTE]

1. Sign in to [Partner Center](https://go.microsoft.com/fwlink/?linkid=2165507).
1. Select **Settings** (gear icon) > **Account settings**.
1. Under **Organization profile**, select **Billing profile** and then the **Developer** tab.
1. Review the primary contact and billing information that is populated from your legal entity. Invoices are sent by email, so be sure to specify the desired email address to receive them.
1. To make changes, select **Update**.
1. If applicable, provide Tax ID/VAT ID settings.
1. To save your changes, select **Update**.

> [!NOTE]

## Publish and certify your application

After you have completed the steps above, your existing _Dynamics 365 apps on Dataverse and Power Apps_ and/or _Dynamics 365 Operations Apps_ will be available for editing in Partner Center. You will also have the option to create new applications.

The final step for publishing your offer live is to certify your existing applications. To create, publish, and certify your application for Microsoft AppSource, follow the appropriate link:

- [For Dynamics 365 apps on Dataverse and Power Apps](/powerapps/developer/common-data-service/publish-app-appsource)
- [For Dynamics 365 Operations Apps](/dynamics365/fin-ops-core/dev-itpro/lcs-solutions/lcs-solutions-app-source)
