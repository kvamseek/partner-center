# Deprecate or restore a virtual machine offer

This article describes how to deprecate or restore virtual machine images, plans, and offers. The deprecation feature replaces the _stop sell_ feature. It complies with the Azure 90-day wind down period as it allows deprecation to be scheduled in advance.

## What is deprecation?

Deprecation is the removal of a VM offer or a subset of the offer from Azure Marketplace so that it is no longer available for customers to deploy additional instances. Reasons to deprecate may vary. Common examples are due to security issues or end of life. You can deprecate image versions, plans, or an entire VM offer:
- **Deprecation of an image version** – The removal of an individual VM image version
- **Deprecation of a plan** – The removal of a plan and subsequently all images within the plan
- **Deprecation of an offer** – The removal of an entire VM offer, including all plans within the offer and subsequently all images within each plan

To ensure your customers are provided with ample notification, deprecation is scheduled in advance.

> [!IMPORTANT]
> Existing deployments are not impacted by deprecation.

## How deprecation affects customers

Here are some important things to understand about the deprecation process.

Before the scheduled deprecation date:

- Customers with active deployments are notified.
- Customers can continue to deploy new instances up until the deprecation date.
- If deprecating an offer, the offer will no longer be searchable in the marketplace upon scheduling the deprecation. This is to reduce the discoverability of the offer.
After the scheduled deprecation date:

- Customers will not be able to deploy new instances using the affected images. If deprecating a plan, all images within the plan will no longer be available and if deprecating an offer, all images within the offer will no longer be available following deprecation.
- Active VM instances will not be impacted.
- Existing virtual machine scale sets deployments cannot be scaled out. If deprecating a plan or offer, all existing scale sets deployments using any image within the plan or offer respectively cannot be scaled out.
> [!TIP]
> Before you deprecate an offer, plan, or image, make sure you understand the current usage by reviewing the [Usage dashboard in commercial marketplace analytics](https://partner.microsoft.com/dashboard/insights/commercial-marketplace/analytics/usage). If usage is high, consider hiding the plan or offer to minimize discoverability within the commercial marketplace and steer new customers towards other available options. To hide an offer, select the **Hide plan** checkbox on the **Pricing and Availability** page of each individual plan in the offer.

## Deprecate an image

Keep the following things in mind when deprecating an image:

- You can deprecate any image within a plan.
- Each plan must have at least one active image.
- You must publish the offer after scheduling the deprecation of an image.
- Images that are published only to preview and have never been published live can be deleted immediately when the offer is still in preview state.
**To deprecate an image**:

1. On the [Marketplace offers](https://partner.microsoft.com/dashboard/marketplace-offers/overview) page, in the **Offer alias** column, select the offer with the image you want to deprecate.
