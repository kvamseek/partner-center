      - question: |
          Where can I get help in setting up my lead destination?
        answer: |
          See [Customer leads from your commercial marketplace offer](partner-center-portal/commercial-marketplace-get-customer-leads.md) for an overview of how to connect your CRM system to your commercial marketplace offers. Remember that regardless of whether or not you connect to a CRM system, you can access your leads in the [Referrals workspace](https://partner.microsoft.com/dashboard/referrals/v2/leads) in Partner Center. If you have an error, review the troubleshooting guidance below. For more support, submit a support ticket through [Partner Center Help and support](https://go.microsoft.com/fwlink/?linkid=2165533). Then select **Offer creation** > **Your type of offer** > **Lead management configuration**.
          
      - question: |
          Am I required to configure a lead destination in order to publish an offer in the commercial marketplace?
        answer: |
          The [Referrals workspace](https://partner.microsoft.com/dashboard/referrals/v2/leads) in Partner Center lets you see and manage all leads from your customers, so you aren't required to configure a CRM system.

      - question: |
          How can I find the test lead in my CRM system?
        answer: |
          When testing the connection to your CRM system, search for "MSFT_TEST" in your leads. If youâ€™re using the Referrals workspace in Partner Center, this step isn't needed. Below is a sample test lead from Microsoft. The format of the test lead varies depending on the lead destination.
          
          ```
          {
              "userDetails": {
                "FirstName": "MSFT_TEST_636573304831318844",
                "LastName": "MSFT_TEST_636573304831318844",
                "Email": "MSFT_TEST_636573304831318844@test.com",
                "Phone": "1234567890",
                "Country": "US",
                "Company": "MSFT_TEST_636573304831318844",
                "Title": "MSFT_TEST_636573304831318844"
              },
              "LeadSource": "AzureMarketplace",
              "ActionCode": "INS",
              "OfferTitle": "Contoso Test"
              "Description": "MSFT_TEST_636573304831318844"
          }
          ```
          
      - question: |
          I have a live offer, but why am I not seeing any leads?
        answer: |
          First, check the [Referrals workspace](https://partner.microsoft.com/dashboard/referrals/v2/leads) in Partner Center to see if your leads are there.
          
          All collected leads should appear there, so if you don't see them in the Referrals workspace, contact support.

          If you see your leads in the Referrals workspace in Partner Center, but not in your CRM system, you can try the following steps:
          - Make sure your connection to the lead destination is valid. We'll send you a test lead after you select **Publish** on your offer in Partner Center. If you see the test lead, the connection is valid.
          - Test your lead connection by trying to acquire the offer preview during the preview step. Select **Get It Now**, **Contact Me**, or **Free Trial** on the listing in the commercial marketplace.
          - Make sure you're looking for the right data. See [Understand lead data](./partner-center-portal/commercial-marketplace-get-customer-leads.md) for an explanation of the lead data we send to your lead destination.

          > [!NOTE]
          > If an issue with your CRM configuration or system caused loss of leads, you can export them from the 
          [Referrals workspace](https://partner.microsoft.com/dashboard/referrals/v2/leads) in Partner Center and then import them to your CRM system.
          
      - question: |
          I configured Azure Blob storage as my lead destination, but why don't I see the lead?
        answer: |
          Azure Blob storage is no longer supported as a lead destination, so you're missing any customer leads generated by your offer. Switch to any of the other [lead destination options](partner-center-portal/commercial-marketplace-get-customer-leads.md). 
                 
      - question: |
          I configured an Azure table as my lead destination. How can I view the leads?
        answer: |
          You can access the lead data stored in the Azure table from the Azure portal. You can also download and install [Azure Storage Explorer](https://azure.microsoft.com/features/storage-explorer/) for free to view your Azure storage account's table data.

          Another option is to view them in the [Referrals workspace](https://partner.microsoft.com/dashboard/referrals/v2/leads) in Partner Center instead.
          
      - question: |
          I configured an Azure table as my lead destination. Can I get notified whenever a new commercial marketplace lead is sent?
        answer: |
          Yes. Follow the instructions in [Configure lead management by using an Azure table](partner-center-portal/commercial-marketplace-lead-management-instructions-azure-table.md) to set up a new flow by using Power Automate that sends an email if a lead is added to the Azure table.
          
      - question: |
          I configured Salesforce as my lead destination, but why can't I find the leads?
        answer: |
          Check if the web-to-lead form is a mandatory field based on a pick list. If it is, switch the field to a nonmandatory text field.

      - question: |
          There was an issue with my lead destination, and I missed some leads. Can I download and import them?
        answer: |
          Yes, you can use the [Referrals workspace](https://partner.microsoft.com/dashboard/referrals/v2/leads) in Partner Center to view the leads or export them and then import them into your CRM system.

      - question: |
          I configured an Azure table as my lead destination. How much will it cost?
        answer: |
          Lead generation data is low. It's less than 1 GB for almost all publishers. The cost depends on the number of leads received. For example, if 1,000 leads are received in a month, the cost is around 50 cents. For more information about storage pricing, see [Azure Storage overview pricing](https://azure.microsoft.com/pricing/details/storage/).
          
          If your question isn't answered, contact Microsoft Support through [Partner Center Help and support](https://go.microsoft.com/fwlink/?linkid=2165533). Then select **Offer creation** > **Your type of offer** > **Lead management configuration**.
          
      - question: |
          I'm receiving email notifications when new customer leads are received. How can I configure someone else to receive these emails?
        answer: |
          Access your offer in Partner Center, and go to the **Offer setup** page > **Lead Management** > **Edit**. Update the email addresses under the **Contact email** field.
