# ISV Success and Marketplace Rewards

Microsoft is strongly committed to the growth and success of its partner ISVs. Part of that commitment is supporting them throughout the entire journey of building, publishing, and selling apps through the Microsoft commercial marketplace. To further this mission, Marketplace Rewards is now included in ISV Success, available—at no cost—to all participants of the program.

## Your commercial marketplace benefits

As you grow through the Microsoft commercial marketplace, you unlock new benefits designed to help you convert customers and close deals. For details on the program and benefits, see [Marketplace Rewards](https://aka.ms/marketplacerewards) (PPT). To see what other Microsoft partners are saying about their experiences with Marketplace Rewards, visit Marketplace [Rewards testimonials](https://aka.ms/MarketplaceRewardsTestimonials).

The benefits at each stage of growth help you progress to the next stage, helping you to grow your business to Microsoft customers, with Microsoft's field, and through Microsoft's channel by using the commercial marketplace as your platform.

Your benefits are differentiated based on whether your offer is [List, Trial, Consulting or Transact](./determine-your-listing-type.md).

Based on your eligibility, the Rewards team will contact you when your offer goes live.  

List, Trial and Consulting offers receive one-time use benefits. Transact offers are eligible for evergreen benefit engagement. For transacting partners, as you grow your billed sales through the commercial marketplace, you unlock greater benefits per billed sales (or seats sold) tier. 

The minimum requirement to publish in the online stores is a Partner ID, so these benefits are available to all partners regardless of Microsoft AI Cloud Partner Program competency, Solutions partner designation, Action Pack subscription status or partner type. Every partner is empowered to grow your business through the commercial marketplace as a platform. 

You get support in understanding the resources available to you and in implementing the best practices, which you can also [review on your own](https://partner.microsoft.com/asset/collection/azure-marketplace-and-appsource-publisher-toolkit).

To check your eligibility for the Marketplace Rewards program, see the [Marketplace Rewards](https://partner.microsoft.com/dashboard/mpn/program/commercialmarketplace) page in Partner Center.

Your steps to get started are easy:

1. Publish an offer in either Microsoft AppSource or Azure Marketplace.
1. To see your list of benefits, go to the [Marketplace Rewards](https://go.microsoft.com/fwlink/?linkid=2165388) page in Partner Center, and select the **Sales and Marketing benefits** tab.
1. To activate sales and marketing benefit, you must first assign a company marketing contact. This contact receives follow-up communications about your Marketplace Rewards.
1. To add or update your marketing contact information, go to the top of the Sales and Marketing benefits tab on Marketplace Rewards page, then select **Add, update, or change**.  Next, do the following:
    1. Select a user from the list. If the user you want to assign isn't in the list, you can add new users in **Account settings**.
    1. Provide an email address for the user that's different from the email address associated with your company's Partner Center account. We'll email instructions for using your Marketplace Rewards benefit to your designated marketing contact's email address.
    1. Provide the contact phone and preferred language for this marketing contact. After you finish entering this information, select **Assign user**.
    1. After you've updated the marketing contact, select **Activate** for the benefit you want to start using. Once you activate a benefit, a member of the Rewards team will contact your marketing contact within a week.
   > [!NOTE]
   > If your offer has been live for more than three weeks and you have not received a message, check in Partner Center to find who in your organization owns the offer. They should have the communication and next steps. If you cannot determine the owner, or if the owner has left your company, open a [support ticket](https://go.microsoft.com/fwlink/?linkid=2165533).

   The scope of the activities available to you expands as you grow your offerings in the marketplace. All listings receive a base level of optimization recommendations and promotion as part of a self-serve email of resources and best practices.
