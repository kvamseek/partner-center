For developers of add-ins in Word, Excel, and PowerPoint, alongside their availability on AppSource and the dedicated add-in store within each application, optimization will significantly influence your positioning within the flyout and file menu. While popularity remains a pivotal factor in shaping the listing, prominence will also be accorded to the following criteria:

- Add-in Quality: Prioritizing add-ins with high-quality user experience and content, as measured by add-in rating, add-in reviews, first-run experience (FRE), free trial feature, and other related metrics. 

- User Engagement: Giving prominence to popular and well-received add-ins to facilitate easy discovery and access, based on your recent and historical data, evaluating by monthly usage, download number, admin deployment numbers, retention rate, and other related metrics.

- Security and Performance: Encouraging developers to prioritize regular updates for their add-ins, ensuring app security, optimizing performance, and enhancing the overall user experience. 

- Compliance: Add-ins should adhere to Microsoft Add-in Store policies and guidelines in order to ensure safety, privacy, and content standards are met.
