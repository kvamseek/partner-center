# Use Marketo to manage commercial marketplace leads

> [!IMPORTANT]
> The Marketo connector has been restored. Update your configurations to receive leads as shown in this article.

This article describes how to set up your Marketo CRM system to process sales leads from your offers in Microsoft AppSource and Azure Marketplace.

## Set up your Marketo CRM system

1. Sign in to Marketo.

1. Select **Design Studio**.

1. Select **New Form**.

   :::image type="content" source="./media/commercial-marketplace-lead-management-instructions-marketo/marketo-2.png" alt-text="Screenshot showing Marketo Design Studio New Form.":::

1. Fill in the required fields in the **New Form** dialog box, and then select **Create**.

   :::image type="content" source="./media/commercial-marketplace-lead-management-instructions-marketo/marketo-3.png" alt-text="Screenshot showing Marketo Design Studio New Form creation.":::
    
1. Ensure that the fields mappings are set up correctly. Here's the list of fields that the connector needs to be entered on the form. 

   > [!NOTE]
   > The field with name "Lead Source" is expected to be configured in the form. It can be mapped to the **SourceSystemName** system field in Marketo or a custom field.

   :::image type="content" source="./media/commercial-marketplace-lead-management-instructions-marketo/marketo-field-details.png" alt-text="Screenshot showing Marketo new form details.":::

1. On the **Field Details** page, select **Finish**.

   :::image type="content" source="./media/commercial-marketplace-lead-management-instructions-marketo/marketo-4.png" alt-text="Screenshot showing finishing the Marketo creation form.":::

1. Approve and close.

1. On the **MarketplaceLeadBackend** tab, select **Embed Code**. 

   :::image type="content" source="./media/commercial-marketplace-lead-management-instructions-marketo/marketo-6.png" alt-text="Screenshot showing the Marketo Embed Code screen.":::

1. Marketo Embed Code displays code similar to the following example.

   ```html
   <form id="mktoForm_1179"></form>
   <script>MktoForms2.loadForm("("//app-ys12.marketo.com", "123-PQR-789", 1179);</script>
   ```

1. Copy the values for the following fields shown in the Embed Code form. You'll use these values to configure your offer to receive leads in the next step. Use the next example as a guide for getting the IDs you need from the Marketo Embed Code example.

   - Munchkin ID = **123-PQR-789**
   - Form ID = **1179**

   The following method is another way to figure out these values:

   - Get your subscription's Munchkin ID by going to your **Admin** > **Munchkin** menu in the **Munchkin Account ID** field, or from the first part of your Marketo REST API host subdomain (`https://{Munchkin ID}.mktorest.com`).
   - Form ID is the ID of the Embed Code form you created in step 7 to route leads from the marketplace.

## Obtain API access from your Marketo Admin

1. See this [Marketo article on getting API access](https://aka.ms/marketo-api), specifically a **ClientID** and **Client Secret** needed for the new Marketo configuration. Follow the step-by-step guide to create an API-only user and a Launchpoint connection for the Partner Center lead management service.

1. Ensure that the **Custom service created** indicates Partner Center.

   :::image type="content" source="./media/commercial-marketplace-lead-management-instructions-marketo/marketo-new-service.png" alt-text="Screenshot showing Marketo API new service form":::

1. Once you click the View details link for the new service created, you can copy the **Client ID** and **Client secret** for use in the Partner center connector configuration.

## Configure your offer to send leads to Marketo

When you're ready to configure the lead management information for your offer in the publishing portal, follow these steps. 

1. Sign in to [Partner Center](https://partner.microsoft.com/dashboard/home) and select **Marketplace offers**.

1. Select your offer, and go to the **Offer setup** tab.

1. Under the **Customer leads** section, select **Connect**.

   :::image type="content" source="./media/commercial-marketplace-lead-management-instructions-marketo/customer-leads.png" alt-text="Screenshot showing the Partner Center Customer leads page.":::

1. On the **Connection details** pop-up window, select **Marketo** for the **Lead destination**.

   :::image type="content" source="./media/commercial-marketplace-lead-management-instructions-marketo/choose-lead-destination.png" alt-text="Screenshot showing the lead destination page.":::

1. Provide the **Munchkin ID**, **Form ID**, **Client ID** and **Client Secret** fields.

   > [!NOTE]
   > You must finish configuring the rest of the offer and publish it before you can receive leads for the offer. 

1. Select **OK**.

   To make sure you've successfully connected to a lead destination, select **Validate**. If successful, you'll have a test lead in the lead destination.
