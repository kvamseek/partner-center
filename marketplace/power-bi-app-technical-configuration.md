# Set up Power BI app offer technical configuration

This article describes how to configure your application package to enable customers to install your Power BI app.
## Configure your app for installation

- **App Installer link** (required) - Provide your Power BI **App installer link** which customers use to install your app. To get the installer link, you need to promote your app to become publicly available outside your organization. For instructions on how to do this, see [Manage the template app releases.](https://go.microsoft.com/fwlink/?linkid=2233788)
- **Azure Active Directory App ID (Client ID)** (optional) - Required for automating the installation of the Power BI app. Provide the service principal (app token) which was used to perform the automated installation. You can add a maximum of 10 IDs. For instructions on how to automate installation see, [Automate configuration of template app installation for your customers.](https://go.microsoft.com/fwlink/?linkid=2233788)

Select **Save draft** before continuing to the next tab in the left-nav menu, **Co-sell with Microsoft**. For information on setting up co-sell with Microsoft (optional), see [Co-sell partner engagement](../co-sell-overview.md?context=%2fazure%2fmarketplace%2fcontext%2fcontext). If you're not setting up co-sell or you've finished, continue with **Next steps**.
