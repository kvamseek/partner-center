# Submit an MCI engagements claim

**Appropriate roles**: Incentives admin | Incentives user

After the engagement is complete, you must submit an engagement claim and be approved to receive payment. This claim should be submitted within the claim expiration timeline defined for your engagement.

## How to submit an engagement claim

1. Go to the **Eligible** section of the **Customers** page or search your **Claims** page for the customer or engagement.
2. Select **Submit claim** under the **Action** column for that customer claim.
3. Submit proof of execution documents, as per the rules of the engagement. This proof includes four items, which can be completed in any order:
    - Invoice (if applicable) – Completed and uploaded to claim by partner
    - Proof of Execution (POE) document – Completed and uploaded to claim by partner
    - Customer Survey (if applicable) – Triggered by partner, completed by customer
    - Partner Survey – Completed by partner
4. Your customer is required to complete a survey. You can send it to them by selecting the **Send customer survey** link.
    - You can check the status of both partner and customer surveys from this page.
    - You can resend the customer and partner survey emails at any time before the engagement's submittal expiration date.
5. Update contact information, if needed.
    - If the contact details in the claim are updated before the survey is completed, manually trigger the survey again, because the previous link will become void.
    - After the customer survey has been completed, you can no longer update the claim's customer contact details.
6. Complete the partner survey. You can access the partner survey directly or email it to your company contacts by selecting the **Send partner survey** link.
    - If you don't access and respond to the partner survey directly through the claim or send the partner survey email using the in-claim link, your partner survey response may not register as completed.
7. Add any comments for Microsoft to consider as part of the claim.
8. Submit your claim by selecting **Submit** at the top or bottom of the claim.
    - If you don't submit the claim, Microsoft won't be able to review it.
    - If you're unable to submit the claim within the expiration timeline specified for your engagement, your claim expires.
    - If your claim expires and you want to restart the process, you can create a new claim. No reactivation function is available for expired claims.
    - If Microsoft needs more information to complete your review, you'll be notified on the **Engagement claim** page and via email. The claim status changes to **Action Required**. If your claim is in the **Action Required** state, you must take the following actions for the review process to continue:
       - Open the claim and review claim comments
       - Update your POE documentation as needed to address all issues identified by review team in claim comments
       - Select Submit to return your claim to the review process
9. After review is complete, Microsoft will communicate the claim approval or rejection decision both on this **Engagement claim** page and via email.
    - Once your claim is approved, you'll receive payment as per the standard 45 day payment cycle of the MCI program.
    - For information on how to review your MCI earnings and payments for approved claims, see [Payouts overview](payouts-overview.md).

## Claim expiration timelines

Once the customer provides consent, you must conduct the engagement, upload your POE, submit your claim, and respond to any requests for action on the submitted claim within the timeline defined per the engagement type. If the timelines shown below aren't met, your claim expires. If your claim expires, in order to restart the process, you can create a new claim. **No reactivation function is available for expired claims**.

| Trigger date for expiration countdown | Claim creation date | Consent date |Consent date| Rejected date | Dispute submit date | Max possible days |
|---|----------------|----------------------|---------|--------|-----------|-----|
| Engagement type | Max days to get consent | Max days to take first submit action | Max days to complete review of submitted claim | Max days to submit dispute | Max possible days |
| Assessments             | 30 | 60  | 90  | 30 | 120 |
| Workshops               | 30 | 90  | 120 | 30 | 150 |
| XS, Small Projects      | 30 | 120 | 150 | 30 | 180 |
| Medium Projects         | 30 | 200 | 230 | 30 | 260 |
| Large, XL, XXL Projects | 30 | 260 | 290 | 30 | 310 |

## Cancelling a claim

If you decide you don't want to proceed with a claim, you can cancel it at any point prior to initial submittal. To cancel the claim, open the claim up, scroll to the bottom and select the "Cancel" button.

## Disputing a rejected claim

If your claim is rejected, you'll have 30 days to submit a dispute, as follows:

1. Open the claim and select **Dispute**.
2. Review claim comments.
3. Update your POE documentation to resolve all issues identified during original review.  
4. Provide any other dispute justification via claim comment as needed.
5. Select **Submit** to ensure your disputed claim is resubmitted to the review process.

If your dispute isn't submitted for review within 30 days of original claim rejection, your claim expires.  

Once your dispute is submitted, the expiration timeline resets to 30 days as a one-time occurrence to allow for review and response. If you're asked to provide further details and again resubmit, the expiration deadline is still counted as 30 days following your initial post-dispute submit action.  

If your dispute resubmittal doesn't adequately resolve the original rejection reasons, your claim will be rejected. Post-dispute rejection is final.  

## Claim history

You can select claim status on the right side of the **Claim detail** page to review the list of historical actions associated with the claim both from your company as well as from the Microsoft side. You can see details like the action performed, the date, and the user that performed the action.
