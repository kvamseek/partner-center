# MCI engagements overview and eligibility

**Appropriate roles**: Incentives admin | Incentives user

This article explains how you can use the **Engagements** section within the Microsoft Commerce Incentive (MCI) program to manage your customers for each engagement and check their eligibility status.

To get to MCI Engagements:

1. Sign in to [Partner Center](https://partner.microsoft.com/dashboard/home) and select **Incentives**.
2. Select **MCI Engagements**.

## Engagements overview

The **Engagements** page lists all earning opportunities, separated by solution area. You can select a solution area below the **Incentives | Engagements** heading to view the list of available engagements for that solution area. You can also filter the engagements by location, status, and role.

- The **Engagements** listing shows name, partner, role, eligibility details, and the status of the engagement.
- The **Eligibility** column shows the eligibility status of enrolled locations.
  - A green icon indicates one or more earning locations for that engagement. The number of earning locations out of enrolled locations is displayed next to the green icon.
  - No green icon means none of the enrolled locations are earning on the engagement.
- Selecting an engagement takes you to its **Summary** page. Once there, you can go to the **Customers** page and **Eligibility** page.
- The **Engagements** list displays only engagements for which your Partner Account has at least one eligible location. If you don't see an engagement listed and your location meets the qualification criteria to deliver that engagement, contact your PDM team or sales team representative to ask to be included in that engagement's eligibility list.

## Summary page

Each engagement's **Summary** page gives a high-level description of the earning opportunity, along with the partner qualification criteria, customer qualification criteria, proof of execution requirements, resource links, and rates.

## Eligibility page

The **Eligibility** page lists all locations enrolled in the MCI program, their eligibility status, and their payee profile status.

- A green check mark next to the eligibility status and payee profile status indicates eligibility to earn on the engagement for that location.
- Select the eligibility status to review any qualification criteria that must be met to earn for that engagement on the location.
- The payee profile status has a link to update the bank or tax profile, if needed.

## Access the Claims section

1. Sign in to [Partner Center](https://partner.microsoft.com/dashboard/home) and select **Incentives**.
2. Select **Customer claims** from the menu.

## Customer claims overview

The Customer claims page shows an all-up view of claims across all earning opportunities, and is sorted by tabs based on the solution area.

At the Customer claims page, you can:

- Export claim data.
- Create new claims in the tab belonging to the relevant solution area.
- Access individual claims.
- Filter claims using the search bar to easily find the desired claims.
- Sort claims by selecting the desired column headers.
- Associate a new customer from your claims page. To associate a new customer:
