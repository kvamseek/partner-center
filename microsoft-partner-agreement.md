# Learn about the Microsoft Partner Agreement (MPA) for CSP program partners

**Appropriate roles**: Global admin

The Microsoft Partner Agreement provides Microsoft partners with a unified, digitally accepted partner agreement. It has a core set of perpetual terms. These terms help Microsoft, partners, and customers support data privacy and security. They also promote compliance and encourage sound business practices.

All Cloud Solution Provider (CSP) program partners (including indirect providers, indirect resellers, and direct-bill partners) should sign the Microsoft Partner Agreement online in Partner Center. Direct-bill and indirect provider partners who operate in the Microsoft Cloud for US Government can also sign the MPA from within Partner Center.

To continue to participate in the CSP program, you must have signed the Microsoft Partner Agreement. If you haven't signed the agreement, you'll receive reminders from Partner Center that you can easily sign the agreement from within Partner Center.

> [!NOTE]
> The MPA must be signed once in every CSP region where your company does CSP business. To learn more, see [Cloud Solution Provider program regional markets and currencies where you can sell CSP offers](regional-authorization-overview.md).

## Verify that your PartnerID is active

1. If you don't have a Microsoft AI Cloud Partner Program account or ID, you need to join the Microsoft AI Cloud Partner Program first. You will get an option to enroll into the program first when enrolling into Cloud Solution Provider Program. [Learn how to join the Microsoft AI Cloud Partner Program](mpn-create-a-partner-center-account.md).

2. Sign in to [Partner Center](https://partner.microsoft.com/dashboard/home) with your Microsoft AI Cloud Partner Program account credentials and select the **Settings** (gear) icon.

3. Select **Account settings**, then **Legal Info**. Select the Partner tab on the page. If the Partner tab is not visible then contact your MPN Admin to check Microsoft AI Cloud Partner Program status.

4. Check the **Program info** section. If Microsoft AI Cloud Partner Program status is **Active**, then you're an active Microsoft AI Cloud Partner Program partner in Partner Center.

5. If Microsoft AI Cloud Partner Program status is **Declined/Rejected** or **Pending**, your account verification has failed. Read [Verify your account information when you enroll in a new Partner Center program](verification-responses.md) to find out how to resolve the verification issue.

> [!NOTE]
> Your PartnerID account credentials may not be the same as your CSP account credentials.

## Confirm your status of CSP program enrollment

Signing the MPA requires that the respective Partner Center account has started the enrollment into one of the CSP program tiers, so this should be checked first.

1. Sign in to [Partner Center](https://partner.microsoft.com/dashboard/home) with your CSP Global admin credentials and select the **Settings** (gear) icon.

2. Select **Account settings**, and then select [Legal Info](https://aka.ms/accountexp/legalInfo) under **Organization Profile**.

3. Check the **Program info** section by clicking the plus symbol (+). If there is no listed **Microsoft Cloud Solution Provider** status, begin the enrollment process for the desired [CSP partner program](./enrolling-in-the-csp-program.md).

4. If **Microsoft Cloud Solution Provider** status is **Active**, then the Partner Center account has an Active CSP program enrollment, and the program tier specifics are listed right below.

5. If **Microsoft Cloud Solution Provider** status is **Qualified**, then navigate to the [**Agreements page**](https://partner.microsoft.com/dashboard/account/v3/settings/agreements) to accept the Microsoft Partner Agreement and complete the CSP program enrollment.

6. If the account verification status is **Rejected** or **Declined**, then the account verification has failed. To find out how to resolve the verification issue, review [Verify your account information when you enroll in a new Partner Center program](verification-responses.md).

7. If you've previously moved to Partner Center as a CSP partner, accept the Microsoft Partner Agreement on the Agreements page using Global admin credentials. You can confirm that the Microsoft Partner Agreement has already been signed from [Legal profile](https://partner.microsoft.com/dashboard/account/v3/organization/legalinfo#csp) **Program info** or by searching for the Microsoft Partner Agreement in the Agreements page.

For accounts that are enrolled as a CSP Indirect Reseller, remember to accept the CSP relationship request with the desired indirect provider.

## Sign the Microsoft Partner Agreement

Only accounts with global admins credentials on the CSP tenant can view and sign MPA in Partner Center. To check account roles, go to **User management** and check that the signed-in account is marked **Global Admin**. If not, the account cannot be used to sign the MPA. A list of global admins can be found for the CSP Partner Center account on the **User management** page.

1. Sign in to [Partner Center](https://partner.microsoft.com/dashboard/home) with your CSP Global admin credentials and select the **Settings** (gear) icon.

2. Select **Account settings**, then select **Agreements**.

   > [!NOTE]
   > If there is no listed Microsoft Partner Agreement in the table, the role on the account signed in is not a global admin. Please work with existing Global Admins to sign the MPA.

3. To view and download the Microsoft Partner Agreement before signing it, select the **View** link.
