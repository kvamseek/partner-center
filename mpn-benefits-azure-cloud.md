# Azure credits

**Appropriate roles**: Global admin | MPN Partner Admin

This article describes how to view and redeem Azure credits (monthly or yearly credits) that are available to Partners in Partner Center. To look at specific Azure credits you receive, refer to respective membership pages. [Learn more](/partner-center/mpn-overview) about membership.

## View Azure benefits in Partner Center

To view your Azure credits, sign in [Partner Center Azure Credits Page](https://partner.microsoft.com/dashboard/v2/benefits/azure). You see a list of Azure credits that are either already redeemed or that are yet to be redeemed.

Following are two types of Azure credits you receive, depending on the active membership you have.

- **Azure monthly credit**: These Azure credits are available to be consumed per month. For example, $100/month means you get $100 Azure credits every month until the end date of your membership. If you don't consume these credits fully by end of the month, these unconsumed credits lapse and don't carry forward to next month. 
- **Azure bulk (yearly) credit**: These Azure credits are available to be consumed for one year from Start date to End date. For example, $6,000/year means you get $6000 Azure credits once. You can consume these $6000 credits anytime between Start date and End date of these credits.

## Redeem your Azure credits

To activate these Azure credits, you must assign these credits to an individual user in your organization. This user gets an email containing the link and steps to redeem these Azure credits. Ask this user in your organization to follow the instructions in that email and complete the redemption process. 

Here are the detailed steps you should follow to assign a user to Azure credits in Partner Center: 

1. Find an Azure credit that isn't yet redeemed and click on it. There are quick filters available on the top of the screen to easily locate the Azure Credits that aren't yet redeemed. 
1. A right side panel opens, look for instructions in **Activation Walkthrough** step and proceed with assigning a user in **Activate Benefits** step.
1. You can search for a user and click **Assign user** OR if you can't find a user, you can click **Add a new user** and then assign Azure credits to this newly added user. [Learn more](/partner-center/create-user-accounts-and-set-permissions) about how to create user.

Change in the user assignment post initial redemption or assignment is allowed with some conditions. 

- For each Azure monthly credit, you can add or remove users at any time capped to only five reassignments. In no circumstances, exceptions are granted post five reassignments are completed.
