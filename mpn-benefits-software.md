1. When you're ready to redeem the key, navigate to **Activate benefits** and follow the instructions.

   If a product requires a product key for installation, it will prompt you for it during the installation process.

   You can get product keys from the same pane in Partner Center where you select the version of software that you wanted to download.

   Not all products require activation. Product activation is required for:

   - Microsoft Windows operating systems
   - Microsoft Office client applications

### How software product activations are counted

The number of software product activations on a product key are counted as follows:

- Software installed on a new machine counts as one product activation.
- Software installed on the same machine with no significant hardware changes isn't counted as a product activation.
- Software installed on the same machine with significant hardware changes counts one product activation.

### Benefits activation messages and meanings

| Message | Meaning  |
|---------|----------|
| *No further details available* message displayed for Windows Server client access license (CAL) benefits. | CALs aren't a downloadable product and aren't edition-specific. The activation of CALs is managed on the server product itself. |
| A message states that you've reached the maximum available activations for a product key when you try to activate software. | You get a set number of activations per product through membership benefits. If you've reached the maximum number of activations, you can't activate more licenses using the provided product key. |

> [!NOTE]
> License keys for Office Professional Plus 2019 obtained through internal use rights (IUR) licenses on Partner Center do not work when installed on macOS.
