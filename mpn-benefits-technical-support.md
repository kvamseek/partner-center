- Admin agents who need to create support on behalf of your customer for cloud products.
- Any account Microsoft Azure Active Directory (Azure AD) or Microsoft Services Agreement (MSA) who wants to create on-premises support requests on behalf of your customer or for your own organization.

The Partner Center [Technical support & consultation benefits](https://partner.microsoft.com/dashboard/mpn/membership/benefits/technical) page shows information about two separate benefits:

- **Technical Product Support incidents**: *See the information that follows in this article.*
- **Technical consultation benefits for ISV partners**

## Activate your benefits

1. Activate your technical benefits (requires Global admin or MPN Partner Admin).

    After activation, all user accounts can view the Access ID and Contract ID needed to associate the benefits with their account.

2. Check the technical support entitlement and supported products to see if your Microsoft AI Cloud Partner Program benefits can be used for your intended product and version.

3. Microsoft Product Support (for recent on-premises products): Use [Support for Business](mpn-benefits-technical-support.md#support-for-business) for on-premises product support.

4. Signature Cloud Support (for cloud products): Users with the Admin agent role select **Customers and service management** to create a request.

## View and activate your technical support benefits

To view or activate your technical support benefits, use the following steps:

1. Sign in to [Partner Center](https://partner.microsoft.com/dashboard/home) with your associated account and select **Benefits**.

> [!NOTE]
> You must have an account associated with the Microsoft AI Cloud Partner Program. If your account is only associated with CSP and not associated with Microsoft AI Cloud Partner Program, you'll get the error message, *You are not authorized for this action*.

2. Select **Technical support & consultation benefits**.

The **Technical support & consultation benefits** page displays your organization's active Solutions Partner designation, ISV or legacy Gold/Silver benefits pack or Microsoft Action Pack membership offers.

3. To activate the benefit, select the benefit name link, on the wizard panel in the “Activate benefit” section select the **Activate** button.

:::image type="content" source="media/mpn-benefits-technical-support/activate-button.png" alt-text="Screenshot of technical consultation activate button.":::

To find a user who has the required permissions to activate your benefits go to [**User Management**](https://partner.microsoft.com/dashboard/account/v3/usermanagement#users)    and filter by **Global admin** or **MPN Partner Admin**.

To use Microsoft Product Support or Signature Product Support, you must activate the benefit.

The user account used for activation must have the Global admin or MPN Partner Admin role.

:::image type="content" source="media/mpn-benefits-technical-support/contract-access-id.png" alt-text="Screenshot of technical consultation contract and access ID page.":::

Access ID and Contract ID are displayed to all users after successful activation. You can use Microsoft Product Support and Signature Product Support (Gold and Silver members) when the Access ID and Contract ID are displayed.

> [!NOTE]
> You will need the Access ID and Contract ID the first time you use Microsoft Product Support or Signature Product Support for each account. After benefits have been associated with your account, you won't need to use the Access ID and Contract ID again.

## Technical support entitlement and supported products

Technical support provides troubleshooting for a specific problem, an error message, or for functionality that isn't working as expected.

*Microsoft AI Cloud Partner Program Product Support* and *Signature Cloud Support* can be used only for supported Microsoft products and versions. (Not all products and versions are supported).

> [!NOTE]
> Your technical support benefits must be activated before you can use them.

As part of the Microsoft AI Cloud Partner Program membership, partners are eligible for the following technical support:

| **Technical support**                                            | **Action Pack** | **Solutions Partner designation** | **Legacy Silver**                                                 | **Legacy Gold**                                                 |
|------------------------------------------------------------------|-----------------|-----------------------------------|-------------------------------------------------------------------|-----------------------------------------------------------------|
| Microsoft Product Support - For recent on-premises products only | 10 Incidents    | 20 Incidents                      | 15 Incidents                                                      | 20 Incidents                                                    |

## Microsoft product support (on-premises)

- You can use the benefit *Microsoft Product Support* for technical support requests only for recent versions of on-premises products.

  - *Recent versions* of on-premises products include only the current product (*N*) and the previous product version (*N-1*).

  - *Previous versions* are supported only if they are within [mainstream support](/lifecycle/policies/fixed), based on the *N-1* support policy.

  - *Nonsupported products and versions*: use the relevant paid support option or purchase a partner support plan.

- You need the Access ID and Contract ID the first time you use the benefit per user account.

- The benefits are associated with your user account until they expire or there are no more support incidents remaining.

- Any user account (Azure AD or MSA) can use technical support for on-premises products if they have the Access ID and Contract ID.

### Support for business

1. Select [**Support for Business**](https://support.serviceshub.microsoft.com/supportforbusiness/create) to create a support request for an on-premises product.
  
   - The Support for Business (SfB) workflow doesn't require a specific role or permissions. Any Microsoft Azure Active Directory (Azure AD) work account or personal Microsoft Account (MSA) can be used.

2. Select the **Product and Support Type**.

3. Your next action depends on if you've previously added your support plan.

   - If you *haven't* added your support plan, select **Do you need to purchase or add more support plans?**, select the **Add Contract** button, and enter the Access ID and Contract ID.

   - If you've added your support plan, the Access ID and Contract ID are associated with your account, and you don't need to add them again.

4. View your support plan under **Types of support** or **Unavailable support plans**.

   Valid support plans are displayed under **Types of support**.


5. If your support plan isn't displayed, select **Unavailable support plans** to view more information on why you can't use your support plan.

    A support plan isn't displayed if it has expired, has no units remaining, or can't be used for the specified product (for example, for versions of products that are no longer supported).

    If you try to use partner support for a product that is no longer supported, you'll see the message **Support plan cannot be used for the specified product**. However, you can purchase *pay-per-incident* (PPI) support if the product is within the [Fixed Lifecycle Policy](/lifecycle/policies/fixed).

6. You can purchase a support incident online if your sign-in using an MSA account for example, Outlook.com, Gmail etc. Unfortunately, Azure AD accounts won't display the option to purchase support see [Paid Professional support isn't available for Active Directory accounts](/services-hub/sfbus/support-for-business/professional-support-aad).

   On the [Create a new support request](https://support.serviceshub.microsoft.com/supportforbusiness/create) page, after you complete **Step 1: Product and Support Type**, scroll down the page until you see the text **Do you need to purchase or add more support plans?** and select **Buy now** to purchase using a credit card.

### Find out how many partner support incidents remain

You can only see remaining incidents through the [Support for Business portal](https://support.serviceshub.microsoft.com/supportforbusiness) after you select an on-premises product. Cloud portals (for example, Azure or LCS) don't show incidents remaining. Instead, they hide the support contract when you have no incidents remaining or it expires. Therefore, the **Support for Business** portal is used for both on-premises and cloud support plans.

To create an on-premises support incident:

- Use the **Support for Business** portal to begin the process.

    We don't create a support request because we don't complete the process.

    **Incidents remaining** information is displayed after entering product information, under the **Types of Support** or **Unavailable support plans** sections.

To find out how many partner support incidents remain:

1. Sign in to the [Support for Business portal](https://support.serviceshub.microsoft.com/supportforbusiness/create) and select **Windows 11** and any version, category, or problem.

    Doing this doesn't create a support request.

    Providing this information displays the **Types of Support** or **Unavailable support plans** sections, which are where you can see incidents remaining.

2. If you need to associate your support contract with your account, expand **Do you need to purchase, or add more support plans** and select the **Add Contract** button to enter your Access ID and Contract ID.

    If your support contract is already associated with your account, your **Partner support** plan is displayed in the **Types of Support** section. The number of incidents remaining is updated when a support ticket is opened or closed.

    If you associated your support contract but it isn't displayed, the selected product or version is invalid, your support contract has expired, or you have no remaining partner support incidents.

3. If you need to check **Partner Signature** support incidents remaining, there's another step: Expand the **Unavailable support plans** section to see the Partner Signature information. Partner Signature support isn't valid for on-premises products, which is why it's displayed in the **Unavailable support plans** section (we selected Windows 11).

    If your Partner support plan is displayed, the selected product or version is invalid, the support contract has expired, or you have no partner support incidents remaining.

    You can purchase more support incidents online if you use an MSA account to sign-in. (You can't use an Azure AD account to purchase paid support).

### Raise a technical support request

:::image type="content" source="media/mpn-benefits-technical-support/submit-request.png" alt-text="Screenshot of technical consultation support request submission page.":::

## Signature Cloud Support (cloud-only)

Legacy Gold or Silver competency partners can use the benefit **Signature Cloud Support** for technical support requests for cloud products only.

Action Pack partners aren't eligible for Signature Cloud Support.

You need the Access ID and Contract ID the first time you use the benefit for Azure, Dynamics 365, and other cloud products. (An exception is Microsoft 365). The benefits are associated with your user account until they expire or there are no more support incidents remaining.

### For non-CSP partners

- Visit the respective admin portal for the cloud product you're seeking support (such as Azure and Dynamics 365).

- You can use Signature Cloud Support by selecting **Help + Support** > **Support Plans** > **Link support benefits** and enter the Access ID and Contract ID in those portals.

> [!NOTE]
> When using the Azure portal, if your support contract is already associated with the account and you attempt to add the same support contract again, you'll see an error message that states *This Access ID is already associated to an account* when you add the Access ID and Contract ID. For more information, see the section, [**Handle the Azure portal error "Access ID is already associated"**](#handle-the-azure-portal-error-access-id-is-already-associated).

### CSP partners 

When creating Azure requests you can use the **Cloud Solution Provider** support plan without adding a support contract.

Users with *Admin agent* role can select [Customers](https://partner.microsoft.com/commerce/customers/list) under CSP in the left navigation menu, select **Service Management**, and select **New request**. When you select the relevant workload, the workload-specific portal
opens, and you add a support contract and create a request.

### Handle the Azure portal error Access ID is already associated

When you use the Azure portal, you use Signature Cloud Support by selecting **Help + Support** \> **Support Plans** \> **Link support benefits** and enter the Access ID and Contract ID.

**If you have Microsoft Action Pack, you don't get Cloud support because it doesn't include Signature Cloud Support. Microsoft Action Pack includes only Microsoft Product Support (on-premises).**

> [!IMPORTANT]
> You might see the error message *This Access ID is already associated to an account. Please contact your Technical Account Manager to obtain a new Access ID.* This error message is invalid for partner program benefits and should be ignored.

You only need to associate the Access ID once for an account. You see the preceding error message if you associate a support contract with an account more than once when using the Azure portal. See the following scenarios.

- If you have gold or silver technical benefits and have previously added the contract for on-premises support, then you use the Azure portal and add the contract a second time to the same account. You only need to associate the support contract with an account once. Therefore, you don't need to Link support benefits in Azure. If you use Link support benefits when the contract is already associated with the account, you see the error and it should be ignored. Use + New Support request and create a support incident as normal and the support plan will be displayed.

- If the support contract has expired or the Signature 10-pack or Signature 5-pack have no incidents remaining, the support contract is hidden because it's invalid. If you Link support benefits again, you see the error because the contract is already associated. You can purchase a new support plan to get Azure support incidents.

- If you have Action Pack benefits. When the Access ID and Contract ID are used there are no benefits displayed because Action Pack only includes on-premises support and the Azure portal only displays valid benefits.
