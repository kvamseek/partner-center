1. Select the down arrow at the far right of the row to expand the subscription's details.

   - **To activate a Visual Studio subscription**, select a user from the list and then select **Assign user**. If the user you want to assign isn't in the list, you can [add new users](create-user-accounts-and-set-permissions.md) in **Account settings**.
  
     Repeat this process for each subscription you that want to assign. Users can manage their subscriptions in the Visual Studio portal.

   - **To reassign a Visual Studio subscription** from one user to another, select **Reassign user**. For this option to appear, 90 days must have passed since the time of that the subscription was activated. For more information, read the [Microsoft Partner Programs Guide](https://aka.ms/partner-benefits-use-guide).

## Manage GitHub subscriptions

1. Select the **Developer Tools** tab > **GitHub Enterprise Cloud subscription**.

1. Select the down arrow at the far right of the row to expand the subscription's details.

1. Activate a GitHub subscription by selecting the **Activate** button. Follow the instructions displayed on the screen to activate the subscription.

## Questions

### When transitioning from a Legacy to a Solutions Partner designation, do Visual Studio subscriptions need to be reassigned?

Yes. When transitioning from a **Legacy** to a **Solutions Partner** designation, partners need to reassign the Visual Studio subscriptions to users.

### When transitioning to the new designation, are new Visual Studio subscriptions be created? How can I make sure that users still can access the subscriptions?

When you reassign users, new Visual Studio subscriptions are created. Partners should reassign the subscriptions to users that still need them.

### Is there a way we can provide a list of users that were previously assigned to Visual Studio subscriptions in Partner Center, with Legacy enrollments, before transitioning to Solutions Partner designation?

Partners participating in the Microsoft AI Cloud Partner Program are responsible for tracking use and consumption of licenses and services provided through the program. Partners are also accountable for developing their own method of tracking license and benefit usage.

#### Do partners also need to reassign other usage-based subscriptions, such as Azure Credits?

Yes. Partners need to reassign other usage-based subscriptions, including monthly and bulk Azure credits.

### Will it be required to reassign licenses during each yearly renewal period?

No, these reassignments are only needed once, during the transition. In following years, you should be able to renew the license (within the renewal grace period) without having to reassign individual user licenses.

### If my Solutions Partner designation changes, will I be required to reassign licenses again?

It depends: If you renew using the same solution area (for example, from Business Applications to Modern Work), you won't need to reassign licenses.

If you change to a different solution area, or no longer qualify for a solutions partner designation, you'll need to reassign the licenses.
