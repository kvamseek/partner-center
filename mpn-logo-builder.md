**Storing and selecting your assets:**

- You can use the Logo Builder library to store the logo and letter assets that you create.
  - You can download those assets when you're ready to create sales and marketing materials.
  - Previously created and saved logos are available in your **Recently saved** library.
     > [!NOTE]
     >  Any legacy Microsoft Partner Network or silver or gold competency logos will not be available.
  - Select **View all** to view your entire library
  - The PartnerID selector enables you to indicate which location you'd like to view or create a logo for if you've created different logos for various business locations.

   > [!NOTE]
   > It takes 24 hours for a change in your membership, such as new Solutions Partner designation, award, or other attainment, to appear in your membership account. If you don't see the desired logo in your library, make sure that 24 hours have elapsed.
