# Associate Microsoft Certification profile ID (MCID) to a Microsoft AI Cloud Partner Program 

**Appropriate roles**: All Partner Center users

This article describes how you can link or unlink your Microsoft Certification profile ID (MCID) with a Microsoft AI Cloud Partner Program account. 

Assessments and certifications help organizations to upskill their employees and additionally helps these organizations to qualify for specific Specializations and Solutions Partner designations program. To learn the details of specific assessment or certifications or training requirements refer to [Specialization ](/partner-center/specializations)or [Solutions Partner designations](/partner-center/introduction-to-pcs) pages. 

## Why this linking is needed

Individual users take assessment or certifications or training with their personal Microsoft Certification Profile ID (MCID). Since these MCIDs are owned by a specific individual, respective individual needs to log in Partner Center and must complete the association. Without this association, even if employees in your organization complete a certification or assessment or training you won't get credit for it. 

Once associated, as and when the assessments or certifications are completed by individuals, these will be automatically reflected in Partner center. Your organization will achieve qualifying points for specific Specialization or Solutions partner designation program within **ten days** of completion of Certification or Assessment.

## Skill link to Partner Center FAQ (Frequently asked questions)

### Can Global admin do the linkage for all the users?

No. Due to privacy considerations, Individual user needs to log in Partner Center and complete the linkage.

### What's the time lag once a certification is taken or linkage is completed to get credit in Partner Center?

It usually takes around ten days once you have done the linkage or completed a fresh certification or assessments or training for it to be reflected into Partner Center Specializations or Solutions Partner designations programs. 

### How do I unlink MCID from the Microsoft AI Cloud Partner Program organization?

Sign in to [Partner Center My Learn profile page](https://partner.microsoft.com/pc/Users/MyAccount), then select **Remove access**. Due to privacy considerations, the user must complete the account linking process themselves.

### A user left Company A and now works for Company B. How can they link their Microsoft Certification profile ID (MCID) with company B?

In this case, individual user must link their MCID with new company B. Once the user links their MCID with company B, it will automatically be unlinked from company A.

### A user left Company A and no longer has access to Partner Center. This user wants to unlink its MCID from company A and not planning to link it with another Microsoft AI Cloud Partner Program organization.

The user’s Azure Active Directory (AAD/work) account must be deleted from the organization’s tenant by the Global Admin after they leave the company. Once deleted, their exams will be removed from the Skills Report on the data refresh date that is around the 10th of the following month. For example: User left the company on January and their AAD/work account were deleted on the same month. The changes will be reflected on the Skills Report after February 10.

### The admin provided sign-in details for a work email account to an individual user but they've had no response.

The admin should first verify the email address used, and then should contact the user to which the account information was provided.

### I'm receiving a message that their association is limited. For example, "You've attempted to associate with a partner organization. However, we require a period of 30 days between associations. Your next available date for a subsequent association is XXX"

To protect against abuse, an individual has a limited number of three associations allowed each year. In addition, there's a 30 day cool off period between each association, which starts at the beginning of the association. Each user can check the date in their profile to see when they can start a new association.
