# Multichannel support â€” using other partners to support customer subscriptions purchased elsewhere

**Applies to**: Partner Center | Partner Center for Microsoft Cloud for US Government

**Appropriate roles**: Global admin | User management admin | Sales agent

Partner Center's multichannel feature supports scenarios in which a customer wants to hire a partner to manage and support a subscription they purchased elsewhere.

Multichannel support applies when a customer:

- Already purchased subscriptions directly from Microsoft or through the Advisor, Open, or EA programs.

- Purchased subscriptions from a third party who is either not in the Cloud Solution Provider program or not a Microsoft Syndication Partner. Customers can't switch existing license-based subscriptions to a different partner in the Cloud Solution Provider program; they must wait until the end of their subscription or cancel before moving.

|To support these services:  | Do this: |
|:---------|:---------|
|License-based services    | To provide support for multichannel accounts, you must request permissions from the customer to manage their subscriptions. For more information, see [Request a reseller relationship with a customer](request-a-relationship-with-a-customer.md).   |
|Usage-based services     |  For a customer who already has a subscription to Microsoft Azure from another channel (such as Advisor, Open, or EA), create a new Azure subscription in Partner Center, manually enter the subscription details, and then cancel the individual services or the entire subscription. Azure CSP can coexist with different channels.<br/><br/> For a customer who already has a subscription to Microsoft Azure from another partner, for example, you can switch Azure services to the other partner.  For more information, see [Switch Azure subscriptions to a different partner](switch-azure-subscriptions-to-a-different-partner.md). |
