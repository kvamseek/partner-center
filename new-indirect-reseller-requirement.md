# Revenue requirement for CSP indirect resellers

**Appropriate roles**: Global admin

Microsoft will implement a minimum revenue requirement for existing Cloud Solution Provider (CSP) indirect resellers beginning in April 2024. Meeting the requirement will be a prerequisite for the resellers' continued CSP authorization.

As of April 1, 2024, if a reseller's trailing-12-months (TTM) revenue for their CSP tenant is less than USD1000 as of the anniversary month of the tenant's activation, the tenant will be subject to termination and the partner will no longer be authorized as an indirect reseller in CSP. Eligible TTM revenue includes perpetual software and is based on the amounts billed to the reseller's indirect provider for transactions assigned to the reseller.

The requirement doesn't apply until after March 2024 to resellers that onboarded to their CSP tenant after April 1, 2023. Likewise, newly enrolling resellers won't need to meet the requirement as a precondition of onboarding.

In preparation for the beginning of enforcement in April, Microsoft will send a series of advance notification emails starting in January to the resellers whose tenants aren't meeting the revenue threshold as of their onboarding anniversary.

Both the indirect reseller and their indirect provider(s) will be sent an enforcement notification during the indirect reseller's onboarding anniversary month informing them that the reseller will be deauthorized from selling with indirect providers if the indirect reseller has less than USD1000 in TTM CSP revenue associated with the reseller's tenant. After deauthorization, the reseller must wait at least one year before re-enrolling for indirect reseller status.
