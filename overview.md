## Manage your account

Whether you're a partner in the Cloud Solution Provider program or a developer selling your apps, you manage your Partner Center account from one location: the [Partner Center](https://partner.microsoft.com/dashboard/home). From there, you can view and modify tenants, business locations, users and permissions, tax information, and specific programs in which your company is enrolled.

In Partner Center, you can purchase a Microsoft Action Pack that provides Microsoft software and tools to develop expertise, such as developing skills toward attaining competencies and earning advanced specializations. The benefits included with these programs help you build solutions and go to market.

## Connect with customers

Build your business profile to display your company's areas of expertise. Highlight your technical and solution-area expertise, showcase the breadth and depth of your skills, and lead in new market opportunities.

Through Partner Center, partners have increased access to marketing resources to help them accelerate time to market, generate leads, and grow their cloud business. The commercial marketplace product catalog, which includes Microsoft AppSource and Azure Marketplace, lets you offer information and in-product purchase experiences.

## Co-sell with Microsoft and other partners

Co-sell is the path for partners to jointly sell with Microsoft and other partners for collaborative, better-together selling and positive customer outcomes. Co-sell lets you use the Microsoft global brand, sales teams, demand-generation capabilities, and the commercial marketplace to reach new customers worldwide. Sell with other partners and with us. Learn more at [Manage co-sell opportunities](manage-co-sell-opportunities.md).

## Manage customer software needs

As a trusted partner, you play a critical role in all stages of the customer lifecycle, regardless of how customers choose to purchase Microsoft software and services. If your customer gives you administrative privileges, you'll be able to deploy and manage subscriptions, maintain performance, set up users, and create support tickets on their behalf. Partner Center provides quick and easy access to Microsoft support on-demand to help you better solve challenges and meet customer needs. Learn more at [offering customer support](customer-support.md).

## Maintain a secure environment

With Azure Active Directory as a main element of your Partner Center account, ensure your team uses [multifactor authentication](partner-security-requirements-mandating-mfa.md) to keep data secure. Privacy safeguards and security are among our top priorities.

## Data and analytics

Partner Center provides a [unified analytics hub](./insights-overview.md) that addresses all your data analytics and business intelligence needs. You can get access to reports, forecasts, and recommendations designed to help you make data-driven decisions for your business.

- Partner Contribution Indicators (PCI) show partner impact on seven key measures of customer success.
- Partner Insights data reports identify where your sales are high, help you find out which customers have deployed their subscriptions or need support, and show how well your products are selling.
