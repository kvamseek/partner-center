# Partner Center for Microsoft Cloud Germany for partners selling to customers in EU and EFTA countries/regions

**Applies to**: Partner Center for Microsoft Cloud Germany

**Appropriate roles**: Global admin | User management admin | Admin agent | Sales agent | Billing admin

Microsoft Cloud Germany is designed to meet strict German data protection requirements and includes a German data trustee, operating under German law, who controls physical and logical access to customer data. All customer data, and the systems that process or control access to customer data, reside in German data centers. The network between these data centers is isolated and dedicated within Germany.

Microsoft Cloud Germany provides a separate instance of [Microsoft Azure](https://go.microsoft.com/fwlink/?linkid=847992), delivered from data centers in Germany. As a result, commercial customers in the European Union (EU) and European Free Trade Association (EFTA) can store and manage customer data in compliance with applicable German laws and regulations as well as key international standards. Microsoft personnel can't access customer data without approval from and supervision by the German data trustee or customer.

> [!IMPORTANT]
> Based on the evolution in customers' needs, our cloud strategy for Germany will focus on delivery of the new cloud regions in Germany that are consistent with our global cloud offering. With this focus, we will no longer be accepting new customers or deploying any new services from the currently available Microsoft Cloud Germany. Existing customers can continue to use the current cloud services available today, which we'll maintain with necessary security updates.
>
> Moving forward, new customers have the option to use the currently available European regions or the new regions in Germany when they become available. For more information, see [Microsoft to deliver cloud services from new data centers in Germany](https://news.microsoft.com/europe/2018/08/31/microsoft-to-deliver-cloud-services-from-new-datacentres-in-germany-in-2019-to-meet-evolving-customer-needs/).

## Migrate customers from Microsoft Cloud Germany to another European region

Before you can migrate a customer subscription from Microsoft Cloud Germany to another European region, you must have an existing Cloud Solution Provider (CSP) account that is located in that region, and is active. If you don't have one, you'll be prompted to create one during CSP account selection in Partner Center. After you create the new account, your customers will be associated with the selected tenant.

### You already have a CSP account

1. Sign in to your CSP Microsoft Cloud Germany tenant as global admin.

1. Navigate to the CSP Overview page from the left menu.

1. When prompted, select **I already have a tenant in the European region**, and then select **Next**. You'll be prompted to sign in to the new tenant.

1. Sign in to the tenant as a Global admin.

1. Review the information on the confirmation page, and then select **Confirm**.

1. If successful, you'll be prompted to select **View details** or **View dashboard** for more information.

    If sign-in fails, it could mean:

    • You aren't a Global admin on the selected tenant

    • The tenant isn't located in a European region

    • The tenant isn't active

    Make the necessary corrections and repeat the process.

### You don't already have a CSP account

1. Sign in to CSP Microsoft Cloud Germany tenant as global admin.

1. Navigate to CSP Overview page on the left menu.

1. When prompted, select **I do not have a tenant in the European region**, and then select **Create new account**.

1. You'll be taken to the Partner Center Enrollment page, where you can create a new tenant and CSP account in a European region.

1. Once you've signed the Microsoft Partner Agreement and the account is active, sign in with the current Microsoft Cloud Germany account.

1. Navigate to the tenant selection form.

1. Select **I already have a tenant in European region** and follow the instructions.
