# Get unified Partner Center insights

**Appropriate roles**: Global admin | Account admin | Executive report viewer | Report viewer

The [Insights dashboard](https://partner.microsoft.com/dashboard/insights/analytics/overview) is a unified reporting dashboard in Partner Center for Microsoft commercial partners who are enrolled in the Microsoft AI Cloud Partner Program.

The Insights dashboard gives you a complete view of your key performance indicators (KPIs) across Cloud products, such as Microsoft Office, Microsoft Azure, and Dynamics 365, and for licensing models such as Cloud Solution Provider (CSP) and Enterprise Agreement (EA). These reports can help you make data-driven decisions for your organization.

## Roles with access to the Insights dashboard

There are two user roles in Partner Center designed specifically for access to Insights:

- *Executive report viewer* gives access to all reporting data sets.
- *Report viewer* gives access to most reporting data sets but not to sensitive data, such as revenue and customer or employee personal information.

A Global admin or an Account admin can assign users these roles, which are assigned either for an entire company or for a specific Microsoft AI Cloud Partner Program location.

> [!NOTE]
> MPN admins were automatically added to the company-wide *Report viewer role*. They can access reports as a Report viewer without any action required by a Global admin or Account admin.
>
> Global admins and Account admins can override these assignments if necessary.
