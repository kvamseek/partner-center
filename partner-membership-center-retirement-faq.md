# Partner Membership Center retirement FAQ

**Appropriate roles**: Global admin | User management admin | MPN admin

We have moved membership management from Partner Membership Center (PMC) to Partner Center, the single destination to manage your business relationship with Microsoft.

By now, your company should have completed transitioning your Microsoft AI Cloud Partner Program membership management to Partner Center.

###### My company hasn't completed migration. How do we engage with the Microsoft AI Cloud Partner Program?

Enroll in the [Microsoft AI Cloud Partner Program](https://partner.microsoft.com/dashboard/account/v3/enrollment/introduction/partnership). For more information about enrollment, see [What is the Microsoft AI Cloud Partner Program?](mpn-create-a-partner-center-account.md)

###### I have been working in Partner Membership Center. Why is it no longer available?

Microsoft's transition from legacy tools to the modern partner ecosystem is nearly complete. The membership functions supported by PMC have fully transitioned to Partner Center.

###### My company is a Cloud Solution Provider. How do we get a PartnerID and accept the Microsoft Partner Agreement (MPA)?

Enroll in the [Microsoft AI Cloud Partner Program](https://partner.microsoft.com/dashboard/account/v3/enrollment/introduction/partnership), then ensure your new PartnerID is associated with your [CSP account](update-your-partner-profile.md#update-your-partnerid-associated-with-your-csp-account). After that, complete the process of signing the [Microsoft Partner Agreement](microsoft-partner-agreement.md).

###### My company is blocked from signing the Microsoft Partner Agreement (MPA), and I'm unable to migrate my Microsoft AI Cloud Partner Program membership from PMC to Partner Center. What should I do?

See the answer to the previous question.

###### Can I enroll into Microsoft AI Cloud Partner Program with my company email ID?

Yes. Company email IDs are supported. However, personal email IDs aren't supported. For more information, see [What is the Microsoft AI Cloud Partner Program?](mpn-create-a-partner-center-account.md).

###### What will happen to my existing PMC PartnerID?

The PMC PartnerID isn't recoverable now that PMC system is shut down. You need to create new Microsoft AI Cloud Partner Program account in Partner Center, then enroll as a new partner to receive a new PartnerID.

###### What will happen with the PMC locations that weren't reviewed and updated for migration?

PMC locations' PartnerIDs aren't recoverable. You'll need to create new ones in Partner Center.

###### I have published or want to publish offers in the Commercial Marketplace. How do I connect my PartnerID to my Marketplace Account?

To begin working in the Commercial Marketplace, [create a commercial marketplace account in Partner Center](/azure/marketplace/create-account).

To change PartnerID associations for existing commercial marketplace accounts, ensure that you're enrolled in the [Microsoft AI Cloud Partner Program](https://partner.microsoft.com/dashboard/account/v3/enrollment/introduction/partnership), and contact [Support](https://partner.microsoft.com/support/?stage=2&topicid=e82f5aba-2576-3124-37e5-437532a50626) for assistance.

###### Where can I find the tools to manage my Microsoft AI Cloud Partner Program membership and benefits?

Partner Center streamlines several business processes to make it easier for Microsoft partners to manage their relationship with Microsoft and their customers. Partner Center allows you easy access to the tools you need to get work done.

You can use Partner Center to:

- Manage your Microsoft account and users
- Engage with customers
- Build relationships with other partners
- Enroll in incentive programs
- Manage your membership in the Microsoft AI Cloud Partner Program
- Manage customer subscriptions
- Bill and get paid
- Contact support
- Publish or explore offers in the Microsoft commercial marketplace, a catalog of thousands of customer-facing transactable services and applications built and delivered by our independent software vendor (ISV) partner

###### I have an inactive account in Partner Membership Center. Can I regain access to it?

No. Partner Membership Center is no longer available. Instead, enroll in the [Microsoft AI Cloud Partner Program](https://partner.microsoft.com/dashboard/account/v3/enrollment/introduction/partnership) and create a brand new account. For more information, see [What is the Microsoft AI Cloud Partner Program?](mpn-create-a-partner-center-account.md)
