# Payment thresholds, methods, and time frames

The estimated time to transfer payments, and the online stores you can receive payments from, can vary depending on your [country/region](#payment-methods-in-countries-and-regions) and payout account type. This article outlines the payment methods supported in each country and region.

For any given country and region, we pay using ACH/SEPA or wire transfer. Some countries and regions also support PayPal as a payment method.

> [!NOTE]
> For more information about when Microsoft issues payouts for the commercial marketplace after a transaction has occurred, see [Payout policy details](payout-policy-details.md). To see your transaction history, see [Transaction history](transaction-history.md).

## Number of days for payments to reach payout account

We'll usually send any payment that's due in a given month by the fifteenth day of that month. However, payment won't reach your account until later. The delay varies, depending on the payment method we use for your account, as described below.

| Payment method | Approximate days to reach account |
| --- | --- |
| PayPal | One business day |
| ACH/SEPA | 2-3 business days |
| Wire transfer | 7-10 business days |

> [!NOTE]
> Due to changes in foreign exchange rates, the exact sales amount may vary slightly from one currency to another. Exchange rates are calculated monthly. Based on when your transaction took place, the appropriate exchange rate is applied. The exchange rate and the date rate for which it was in force are indicated on your payout report in the columns exchangeRate and exchangeRateDate respectively.
