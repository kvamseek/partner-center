# Provide billing support for your customers and help answer their billing questions

**Appropriate roles**: Global admin | User management admin | Helpdesk agent | Billing admin | Sales agent

You own the billing relationship with your customers, and you're responsible for answering the billing-related questions your customers might have.

- You're responsible for on-time payments to Microsoft.

- We recommend establishing a clear collections policy with customers. The policy should detail your collections process and when access to the customer's subscriptions, services, or software will be affected.

- If necessary, you can disable your customer's access to a product for non-payment.

## Microsoft partner support guidance

Partners transacting in the Cloud Solution Provider (CSP) model are the trusted advisor to their customers and own the relationship end to end, including support when their customer has a question or issue. Through support touch points, partners can learn more about the customer and their business to identify new services and solutions that drive value.

To fulfill the support requirement, a partner may:

- Resell support from another entity.
- Outsource all or part of their support structure.
- Set up a structure to provide support directly.
- Charge for all or part of the support provided to customers.

The partner should articulate to their customers the support the partner provides, the service hours and contact method, and the pricing (if charging for support).

> [!NOTE]
>If you are not a CSP and have questions about customer billing, see the specific portal for the appropriate products or services.

Partners must receive incoming support requests from customers, diagnose issues to the best of the partner's ability, and resolve issues that are within scope of the baseline support boundaries. If a partner is unable to resolve an issue, they can escalate issues to Microsoft using the following support vehicles:

- **Commercial** issue support is available to all partners in the CSP program.

- **Technical** issue support is available through:

  - Premier Support for Partners (PSfP) (fee-based)
  - Advanced Support for Partners (ASfP) (fee-based)
  - Signature Cloud Support (included with Gold/Silver competency)
