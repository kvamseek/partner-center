This article describes the criteria used to help you qualify to be a Microsoft Training Services Partner.

To meet the base criteria for KPI, you need: 1000 Courseware completion KPI and 200 exam unit purchases.  To calculate, use the Exam Unit KPI, Fundamentals and others Courseware & Exams (1 unit = 0.5 KPI), and 1 unit of Advanced Courseware & Exams (1 unit = 1 KPI),  for  courseware completion  KPI -Max Fundamentals and others Courseware contribution: 300 KPI, and for Exam Unit Purchase-  Max Fundamentals and others Exams contribution: No Max.
To meet the base criteria for Surveys, you need a 4.25+ Survey Response Score. Scoring is applicable to Advanced role-based course surveys only. Scoring is based on nine selected partner-influenced survey questions. While Fundamentals aren't included in the benchmark score, all Microsoft courses including Fundamentals need to leverage MTM. Scores count only if they are associated to an eligible MCT instructor.
You must qualify for one Solution Area, meeting at least one solution area with the following number of surveys completed:
Infrastructure: 200 surveys. Data & AI: 200 surveys. Digital & App Innovation: 200 surveys. Modern Work: 200 surveys. Security: 200 surveys. Business Applications: 200 surveys.
You must earn a designation in at least one solution area.

To be eligible for the Training Services program, within the 12 months prior to the anniversary date or program launch date partners must meet the base criteria. The base criteria includes completing 1000 KPI courseware, purchasing 200 exams, and achieving an overall survey score of at least 4.25. When you meet these criteria, you qualify for the program. To qualify for specific solution areas, partners must also meet the Performance Depth criteria, which includes achieving an average survey score of at least 4.25 across a minimum of 200 surveys for the given solution area.

## Base criteria (detailed)

There are three main aspects of base criteria as follows:

### Courseware completions

1,000+ courseware completion units associated to partner's V ORG ID in the completed 12 months prior to an anniversary date.

Total Score= Fundamental and Others Courseware Points+ Advanced Courseware Points

| Activity | Fundamental and others | Advanced |
|----------|------------------------|----------|
| **Each achievement code redemption weight** | 0.5 | 1 |
| **Limit on number of points** | 300 (600 Fundamental and Others courseware x 0.5 KPI) | No limit |

### Exam units completions

200+ exam unit KPI units associated to partner's ORG ID in the completed 12 months prior to anniversary date. Exams are split between **Fundamental and Others** worth 0.5 KPI and **Advanced Role-Based** worth 1.0 KPI. There's no max KPIs from Fundamental and Others (differing from courseware completion KPI) meaning that the 200-unit KPI threshold could be achieved solely with Fundamental and Others. Both categories of exams and associated units / KPIs are viewable to the partner.

Total Score = Fundamental and Others Certification Points + Advanced certification points

| Activity                          | Fundamental and Others |  Advanced |
|-----------------------------------|------------------------|-----------|
| Each exam unit purchase weight    | 0.5                    |  1        |
| Limit on number of points         | No Limit               | No Limit  |

### Average response score

 4.25+ average response score in all advanced **Metrics that Matter** surveys in the completed 12 months prior to the partner's anniversary date.

The Metrics that Matter (MTM) scores for advanced role-based courses are analyzed in two ways: the overall average score for all courses, and the overall average score per Solution Area. Surveys are used to collect data, and each question is scored on a scale of 1 (low) to 5 (high). To calculate the average score, the total number of points is divided by the number of questions answered. While partners receive scores for all questions, only a subset of nine questions are used to calculate the partner's KPI metrics.

## Individual solution area (detailed qualification criteria)

The individual solution area has two requirements:

### Survey completions

200 **Metrics that Matter** surveys completed for each Solution Area designation that you're trying to achieve. The dashboard would show each of the six solution areas, and how many surveys have been returned for courseware tied to each.

### Average response score

4.25+ response score in advanced **Metrics that Matter** surveys in the completed 12 months prior to their anniversary date for each Solution Area designation a partner is seeking to earn. Example: If a partner meets all other requirements for Biz Apps and Security but has an overall response score of 4.3 for Biz Apps and 4.0 for Security, they would only be badged in Biz Apps.

## Viewing your status with score

Use the following steps to see your partner capability score:
1. Sign in to [Partner Center](https://partner.microsoft.com/dashboard/home) and select **Membership**.

   If you don't see the Membership workspace, check your assigned roles in Partner Center. You must have the Global admin or MPN Partner Admin role to view the Membership workspace.
