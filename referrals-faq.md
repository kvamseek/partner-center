## How do I know whether Microsoft accepted or declined a co-sell deal?

Go to the respective opportunity in Partner Center to view the status **Microsoft** section of the deal.

- If your request is declined, Microsoft seller details aren't displayed. (If the Microsoft seller accidentally declined the request, recreate the opportunity and invite Microsoft.)
- A reason for a deal being declined isn't displayed if:
  - The deal expired before Microsoft could respond to it.
  - The deal value is less than USD25,000.
- A declined reason of *No corresponding Microsoft customer record could be found* means that our sales team can't assist you with the deal because Microsoft doesn't have a relationship with the customer.
- A declined reason of *No Microsoft seller directly manages this customer* means that our sales team can't assist you with the deal because the selected customer isn't a customer managed by Microsoft.

## How can I get more co-sell opportunities from Microsoft?

To get more co-sell opportunities that are appropriate for your business, use the following tips:

- **Respond quickly to deals**. When you respond to incoming requests promptly, your visibility is progressively increased in future partner search results. Make sure your team responds quickly with your intent.
- **Be selective about the deals you accept**. We monitor the types of deals that you accept or decline and use that information to help you find similar deals. Accepting deals that aren't a good fit doesn't improve your search results and could affect the quality of the opportunities that you receive.
- **Report estimated deal sizes, closing dates, and the final status of your deals, whether won or lost**. We use this information to continue to provide you with quality referrals.
