# New user experience in Referrals

**Appropriate roles**: Referral admins

This article describes features of the Referrals workspace in Partner Center, including improvements to [the Deal Details page](#deal-details) in the **Co-sell opportunities** and **Leads** sections.

> [!NOTE]
> The new deal flow has a new view as well. Please try it out and give us your feedback. For more information, see [New deal creation flow](#new-deal-creation-experience).

## Grid view  

The **Referrals | Co-sell opportunities** page for deal management has been improved with a grid view.

:::image type="content" source="media/referrals-user-guide/cosell-opportunities.png" lightbox="media/referrals-user-guide/cosell-opportunities.png" alt-text="Screenshot of co-sell deals in grid view.":::

You can sort deal information on the page by **Deal name**, **Customer name**, **Status**, and **Created on** by selecting the column header.

There are tabs for **Inbound**, **Outbound**, and **Favorites**.

All of the action buttons are available within their relevant tabs.

:::image type="content" source="media/referrals-user-guide/new-deal.png" lightbox="media/referrals-user-guide/new-deal.png" alt-text="Action buttons within the tabs.":::

When there's more than one page of deals, you can go to the other pages using the page numbers below the grid. You can also change the number of deals you see on the page using the deals per page drop-down menu.

:::image type="content" source="media/referrals-user-guide/grid-updated-rows.png" lightbox="media/referrals-user-guide/grid-updated-rows.png" alt-text="Screenshot of multi-page grid.":::

You can also display more rows per page, by adjusting it using the drop-down menu in the right bottom corner of the grid view.

:::image type="content" source="media/referrals-user-guide/grid-view-rows.png" lightbox="media/referrals-user-guide/grid-view-rows.png" alt-text="Screenshot of number of rows displayed in the grid.":::

To filter what is displayed, use the following step:

- Select **Filters** next to the search bar to display the **Filters** side panel.

:::image type="content" source="media/referrals-user-guide/deal-filters.png" lightbox="media/referrals-user-guide/deal-filters.png" alt-text="Screenshot of filter options.":::

The filters that you select are displayed above the columns in **Applied filters**. Then can be cleared by selecting **Clear all**.
_You can filter up to 50 countries/regions using the Country filter._

:::image type="content" source="media/referrals-user-guide/applied-filters.png" lightbox="media/referrals-user-guide/applied-filters.png" alt-text="Screenshot of applied filters.":::

## Preview deal details

You can now preview deal information right from the grid view by hovering over the deal name column, without navigating into the deal details page. Additionally, you can open a deal in a new tab with a handy shortcut at the top of the preview card. Here's a screenshot of the preview.

:::image type="content" source="media/referrals-user-guide/preview-card.png" lightbox="media/referrals-user-guide/preview-card.png" alt-text="Screenshot of preview of a deal.":::

## Customize your view with the column chooser

As a referral admin, you can now customize your grid view with upto nine columns in the Co-sell opportunities page. Here's a screenshot of how you can customize the view.

:::image type="content" source="media/referrals-user-guide/column-chooser.png" lightbox="media/referrals-user-guide/column-chooser.png" alt-text="Screenshot of the column chooser.":::

Several partners have asked for Referral ID or Microsoft status to be shown in the grid view and this feature allows you to see whichever columns you would like in the grid view.

## Bulk operations on deals

The **Upload** button and its functionality are in a side panel. Deals can be uploaded from both the **Inbound** and **Outbound** tabs.

You can export deals using the **Download** button available in each tab. Downloading is context-aware, and downloads the filtered list of opportunities. For example, when you filter the results of the **Outbound tab**, only the filtered results are downloaded.

:::image type="content" source="media/referrals-user-guide/upload-cosell.png" lightbox="media/referrals-user-guide/upload-cosell.png" alt-text="Screenshot of upload deal options.":::

## New deal creation experience
The new deal button now takes you to a new step-by-step wizard experience to help you create a new deal as shown below. To submit comments or suggestions about the new layout, select the smile icon at the top of the page.

:::image type="content" source="media/referrals-user-guide/new-deal-flow.png" lightbox="media/referrals-user-guide/new-deal-flow.png" alt-text="Screenshot of new deal creation experience.":::

For a detailed guide on creation of co-sell opportunities, see [Manage Co-sell opportunities](manage-co-sell-opportunities.md).

## Deal Details page

The **Deal Details page** in the **Co-sell opportunities** section has been improved to make it easier and more intuitive to use.

On the left navigation bar, you can select links to four pages:

- [Deal details](#deal-details)
- [Solutions](#solutions)
- [Help from Microsoft](#help-from-microsoft)
- [Partner collaboration](#partner-collaboration)

The following sections describe the pages in detail.

### Deal details

On the **Deal details** page, you can see workflow stages and the type and estimated value of a deal.

You can also edit some of the deal information during the various workflow stages in the deal lifecycle.

:::image type="content" source="media/referrals-user-guide/deal-details.png" lightbox="media/referrals-user-guide/deal-details.png" alt-text="Screenshot showing deal details tab in Partner Center.":::

2. Select **Edit** and make any changes.
3. Select **Save**.

### Help from Microsoft

When you select **Help from Microsoft** in the left navigation bar, a menu appears on which you can identify the type of help you'd like.

:::image type="content" source="media/referrals-user-guide/identify-help-type-dropdown.png" alt-text="Screenshot of dropdown menu in Partner Center to identify the type of help you'd like.":::

You must share the customer's contact information with the Microsoft representative when you request help. You can share notes as well.

The following image shows how the **Deal details** page displays updated status after a Microsoft seller accepts a referral.

### Partner Collaboration

In **Partner Collaboration**, you can invite other partners to deals for co-selling.  

We encourage you to choose partner collaboration only if you're interested in a partnership. Ensure that you have your own vetting processes to ensure authenticity of the partners reaching out to you through this channel.

You can now navigate to the Previous or Next deal right within the deal details page as shown below.
