# Registration ID number information

**Appropriate roles**: Global admin

If you're an indirect provider, direct-bill partner, or indirect reseller, and you're doing business with a new or existing customer in the following countries/regions, you must provide a registration ID number for the business. For detailed information, see the table that follows, [Countries/regions where registration ID is required](#countriesregions-where-registration-id-is-required).

We use the registration ID number to review the details of your account. If the country/region you're doing business in isn't listed below, a registration ID number is optional.

## Entering a mandatory registration ID number versus optional

For countries/regions for which entering a registration ID number is *mandatory*, the label above the text box in Partner Center indicates the type of number that is required. The required registration ID number (for example, a *tax identification number* or a *traffic registration number*) depends on the country/region.

For countries/regions for which entering a registration ID number is *optional*, you can enter the company registration ID. Don't enter a personal ID.
