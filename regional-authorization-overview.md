# Cloud Solution Provider program regional markets and currencies where you can sell CSP offers

**Appropriate roles**: Global admin

Your company's location determines your market. Your market includes the regions and/or countries where you can sell Cloud Solution Provider (CSP) program offers.

For example:

- If your company is located in the United States, you can sell CSP offers to customers in the U.S. and in United States Minor Outlying Islands.
- If your company is located in Brazil, you can sell CSP offers to customers only in Brazil.
- If your company is located in the Africa region, you can sell CSP offers to customers in all 18 countries in the Africa region.

> [!NOTE]
> The customers' locations described in the above examples are not necessarily the physical locations of the company. Instead, it depends on the country/region set in the tenant. If the customer located in Brazil has a tenant set in the United States, the customer will be out of sales territory for CSPs in Brazil. Instead, the customer is eligible to transact with CSPs in the U.S.

Before you can order CSP offers on behalf of a customer, the customer must sign the Microsoft Customer Agreement. You can find the applicable Microsoft Customer Agreement for your region/country in [Microsoft Customer Agreements by region and language](agreements.md).

## Azure plan for CSP region availability

The Azure plan for CSP is available in fewer regions than Azure software for CSP. For the latest updates on regional availability for the Azure plan, see [Purchase the Azure plan](purchase-azure-plan.md).

> [!IMPORTANT]
> You need to confirm that a customer has accepted the Microsoft Customer Agreement by providing information about the person who signed it. For more information, see [Confirm a customer's acceptance of the Microsoft Customer Agreement](./confirm-customer-agreement.md).

To determine where you can sell CSP offers, find your company's location in one of the following lists. You must have an active PartnerID for the location you want to sell in.

## For unsupported countries/regions

If your country/region isn't supported, establish the customer CSP relationship using the Office admin URL.

- Direct-bill partners use this URL: <https://portal.office.com/partner/partnersignup.aspx?type=ResellerRelationship&id=partnertenantguid&csp=1&msppid=0>.
  - Replace **partnertenantguid** with your tenant ID.

- Indirect resellers use this URL: <https://portal.office.com/partner/partnersignup.aspx?type=IndirectResellerRelationship&id=IRtenantguid&csp=1&msppid=IRPartnerID&indirectCSP=IPtenantguid>.
  - Replace **IRtenantguid** with your tenant ID. Replace **IRPartnerID** with your PartnerID, and replace **IPtenantguid** with your indirect provider tenant ID.
