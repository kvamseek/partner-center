# Rejected co-op claims

**Appropriate roles**: Incentives admin | Incentives user

If the materials you provided with your co-op claim are determined to be insufficient, it will be rejected. You can view the reasons for the rejection in the **History** field of your co-op claims page. To dispute the rejection, use the following procedure:

## Dispute a rejected co-op claim

1. Sign in to [Partner Center](https://partner.microsoft.com/dashboard/home) and select **Incentives**.

2. Select **Co-op management**.

3. Select the co-op claim you want to dispute. The co-op claim page opens.

4. At the bottom of the page, select **Dispute**.

The co-op claims validation team will review the claim within five business days. During this time, the status will show as **Disputed**. We may contact you to request additional information. When the review is complete, the validation team will update the status to either **Approved**, **Rejected**, or **Partner Action Required**.
