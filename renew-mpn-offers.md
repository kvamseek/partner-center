# Renew your Membership offers for Solutions Partner designations during the renewal window

**Appropriate roles**: MPN Partner Admin

## Renewal

For every Membership offer, there's a corresponding **Anniversary Date**. The Solutions Partner designation qualification period is 30 days prior to your anniversary date. If you meet all the Solutions [Partner designation requirements](./partner-capability-score.md) at any time in these 30 days, you will have the option to purchase the Solutions Partner designation benefits during your renewal window.

Your renewal window is **30 days** after your anniversary date. Your benefits continue during this 30-day renewal window.

When you renew during that anniversary date-plus-30-day window, your benefits remain the same. If you *don't* renew within your renewal window, you lose your benefits and Solutions Partner designations and badge.

> [!NOTE]
> When you renew during the renewal window, your new anniversary date is 365 days **after the day you make the payment and itâ€™s received by Microsoft**.
