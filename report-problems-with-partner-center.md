# Get help and contact support in Partner Center

**Applies to**: Partner Center | Partner Center for Microsoft Cloud for US Government

**Appropriate roles**: All partners interested in Partner Center

This article describes how to address issues with Partner Center. For help with other partner-related issues with **Azure**, **Microsoft 365**, **subscriptions**, **invoices**, and more, see **[Which support portal should I use?](support-resource-options.md)**.

### Contact support

1. Log into [Partner Center](https://partner.microsoft.com/dashboard/home), using your [work account](azure-active-directory-tenants-and-partner-center.md).

1. Select the **Help** (**?**) icon. The **Help + support** panel opens and displays workspace-specific links to relevant Partner Center documentation.

   If the documentation doesn't give the help you need, you can select **Contact Support** at the bottom of the page.

1. Fill in the following information:

   - **Problem summary**: Brief description of the problem.
   - **Workspace**: Choose from the Partner Center workspaces that you have access to. The current workspace is filled in automatically.
   - **Problem type**: Select from recommended content. Or, update the problem summary to get new suggestions. The problem types displayed are specific to the selected workspace.

1. Select **Review solutions**. A pane shows alerts, steps, or related documents that may help resolve your issue.

1. If you still need help, select **Create support request**.

1. Fill in all required details, and select **Submit**.

   A partner support representative will follow up with you by phone or email. If your request is complex and you have low availability, you should use [schedule a support appointment](./schedule-support-appointment.md).

## Hours of operation

See [Partner Support availability](support-hours.md) to see the availability in your geographical region.

## Report a problem on behalf of a customer

If your customer has a service problem that you can't resolve, your indirect provider can [file a support ticket for the customer](report-problems-on-behalf-of-a-customer.md).

Partner Center users shouldn't create partner support requests on behalf of other Partner Center users because it can delay request resolution and cause confusion. For example, other users can't see the requests you created online or schedule an appointment. Your user role information is invalid for other users. Extra security checks are required for some requests.

## View your support requests

You can only see requests you created online using your [work account](azure-active-directory-tenants-and-partner-center.md).

1. From your current workspace within the [Partner Center](https://partner.microsoft.com/dashboard/home), select the **Help** icon (**?**) to open the **Help + support** panel.

2. Select the **View my support requests** at the bottom of the panel to open the **Help + support** workspace. This panel contains a table of all your current and past support requests.

## Security check

When first contacted by a partner support representative, you may be asked to pass a security check. A security check is standard practice and is done to verify your identity and to ensure your company's data and information are protected.
