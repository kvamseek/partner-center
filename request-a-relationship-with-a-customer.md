# How to request a reseller relationship from a customer in Partner Center

**Appropriate roles**: Admin agent

If you want to manage a customer's service or subscription on their behalf, the customer must grant administrator permissions for that service or subscription and sign the Microsoft Customer Agreement.

If you want to establish a reseller relationship with a customer and to manage only the Azure subscriptions that you provision, you don't need to obtain administrator permissions.

> [!NOTE]
>The option to not request permissions is not available to partners operating in Microsoft Cloud for US Government or Microsoft Cloud Germany.

## Invite a customer to establish a reseller relationship with you

You can request a reseller relationship with a customer from within your country/region or your same market. To request a reseller relationship, follow the steps at [Invite a customer to establish a reseller relationship with you](customers-revoke-admin-privileges.md#invitesteps).

## Where a customer accepts an invitation

Where a customer accepts an invitation to establish a reseller relationship depends on whether the customer is in a public or national cloud:

|Type of cloud customer  | Where the customer accepts a reseller relationship invitation|
|---------|---------
| Customer in public cloud | Microsoft 365 Admin Center |
| Customer in Partner Center for Microsoft Cloud Germany | Microsoft Office Admin portal |
| Customer in Partner Center for Microsoft Cloud for US Government | Microsoft Office Admin portal |
