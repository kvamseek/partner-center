# Reset a user's password in Partner Center

**Appropriate roles**: Global admin

> [!NOTE]
> If you're enrolled in the Cloud Solution Provider (CSP) program in Microsoft Cloud Germany, see [User management in Partner Center for Microsoft Cloud Germany](user-management-in-partner-center-for-microsoft-cloud-germany.md) for information about resetting a user's password.

If users forget their passwords, assign them a temporary password. They can use it the next time they sign in to Partner Center.

## Reset a user password as an admin

1. Sign in to [Partner Center](https://partner.microsoft.com/dashboard) and select the **Settings** (gear) icon.

2. Select the **Account settings** workspace, then **User management**.

3. Select the user from the list.

4. Choose **Reset password** at the bottom of the page.

5. You will see a confirmation screen with a temporary password. Copy the temporary password and send it to the new user. The temporary password will not be accessible after you leave the screen. When the user first signs in, they will be prompted to update their password.

> [!NOTE]
> Only a Global admin can reset the password for a global admin. Therefore, you should have a minimum of 2 global admins to avoid the risk of your only global admin getting locked out.
