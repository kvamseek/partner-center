# Revenue summary

The [Revenue summary](https://partner.microsoft.com/dashboard/payouts/reports/incentiverevenue) in the Payouts workspace can help you to understand:

- Incentives eligibility of revenue generated through partner-enabled transactions on commerce
- Why some revenue might be ineligible for earnings (If revenue or usage is deemed ineligible, refer to the [Ineligibility reasons](#ineligibility-reasons) section to understand next steps, if any.)
- Azure consumption through managed services (Partner Admin Link—PAL)
- BizApps usage with partner associated as PAL

The Revenue summary is in the Payouts workspace, along with the [Transaction history](https://partner.microsoft.com/dashboard/payouts/reports/transactionhistory) and [Payments page](https://partner.microsoft.com/dashboard/payouts/reports/incentivepayments). It displays revenue information for Microsoft commerce incentives only. It isn't applicable for other incentive programs, Azure Marketplace, and Store payouts.

The following diagram shows how revenue is evaluated and reported at Partner Center.

The Revenue summary is updated only after transactions have been evaluated, so there's a delay before transaction information becomes available. For example, Azure consumption in October doesn't appear in the Revenue summary until November.

## What you can do with the Revenue summary

You can use the Revenue summary to:

- Look up eligible revenue, and the amount of resulting earnings, by customer or subscription.
- Look up any ineligible revenue and learn the reason why that revenue was classified ineligible for earnings.
- Supplement what you learn from the [Transaction history](https://partner.microsoft.com/dashboard/payouts/reports/transactionhistory) with insights about underlying revenue amounts.
- [Export data](#exporting-data) about ineligible transactions—including [ineligibility reasons](#ineligibility-reasons) and [attributes](#exported-data-attributes)—to help you to understand why those transactions didn't earn incentives.

## Who can use the Revenue summary

Users with the *Incentive users* and *Incentive admins* roles on Partner Center have access to the Revenue summary. (To learn more about getting users set up with roles and passwords, see [Assign roles and permissions](permissions-overview.md).)

The information that's available in the Revenue summary (and the [Transaction history](https://partner.microsoft.com/dashboard/payouts/reports/transactionhistory) and [Payments](https://partner.microsoft.com/dashboard/payouts/reports/incentivepayments) pages as well) depends on the program and Microsoft AI Cloud Partner Program combinations that users and admins have access to.

## When data becomes available

Azure consumption data is typically evaluated several weeks after the month in which consumption or usage occurs. The Revenue summary is updated only after that evaluation is complete. The evaluation process results in a delay between when transactions occur and when they're reported, so you won't be able to see consumption for the current month in the Revenue summary. (As an example, data for March would typically be evaluated in about the third week of April, and Revenue summary information would typically be updated shortly thereafter.)

New commerce transactions for Modern Workplace, Dynamics, and customer-adds are evaluated for incentives immediately after invoice generation, and the Revenue summary page is usually updated 24 to 48 hours thereafter.

Data in the Revenue summary can be filtered by enrollment partner ID, program, and engagement.

## Total revenue eligible for earnings

Total distinct revenue that became eligible for incentives for at least one  engagement.

> [!NOTE]
> This total was removed because it didn't represent the distinct revenue amount, but rather represented the sum of every engagement it was eligible for. This total is planned to be reintroduced after the page infrastructure is updated.

## Total revenue ineligible for earnings

Total distinct revenue that became ineligible for incentives under all engagements.

> [!NOTE]
> This total was removed because it didn't represent the distinct revenue amount, but rather represented the sum of every engagement it was eligible for. This total is planned to be reintroduced after the page infrastructure is updated.

## Customer summary view

The Customer summary view shows aggregated revenue by customer name and program or engagement.

Customer summary insights include:

- **Top 10 by eligible revenue** shows the top 10 customers contributing to the maximum eligible revenue.
- **Top 10 by ineligible revenue** shows the top 10 customers contributing to the maximum ineligible revenue.
- **Top 10 by earnings** shows the top 10 customers contributing to maximum earnings.

You can search for information about any customer in the customer summary, not just the top 10.

## Eligible transactions

*Eligible transactions* are transactions that produce revenue that is eligible for earnings payments.

You can search for information about eligible transactions by customer ID or subscription ID. However, you can't export data about eligible transactions.

## Ineligible transactions

*Ineligible transactions* are transactions that are ineligible for earnings payments.

- The reasons why any transactions are considered ineligible for earnings are listed in the [Ineligibility reasons](#ineligibility-reasons) section of this article.
- You can search for and [export data](#exporting-data) about ineligible transactions to help you find out why you may not have earned Microsoft Commercial Incentives (MCI).
- The Revenue summary always displays the latest revenue classification (so you can't see how a transaction was classified a month before). A transaction marked ineligible one month could be marked eligible the next month.

Ineligible transactions listed in the Revenue summary have attributes that include:

- Product
- Ineligible revenue
- [Ineligibility reason](#ineligibility-reasons)
- Subscription ID
- Customer name (available after a subscription is invoiced for the first time)

You can search ineligible transactions by customer name and subscription ID. (The number of records displayed is limited to 10.) If the information you find doesn't answer your questions, contact support for help.

## Ineligibility reasons

*Ineligibility reasons* in the three tables that follow indicate why revenue was classified ineligible for earnings. Each row in the tables also has an explanation about whether and how a partner with ineligible earnings can become eligible for earnings again.

Some ineligibility reasons in these tables might not be applicable for a particular engagement.

There are three categories of ineligibility:

- [Ineligible customer](#ineligible-customer)
- [Ineligible partner](#ineligible-partner)
- [Ineligible transaction](#ineligible-transaction)

### Ineligible customer

|Ineligibility reason|Partner action required?|How to become eligible again|
|---------|---------|---------|
|Customer is public sector|Yes, if customer is in United States, Puerto Rico, or India|If you responded to a proof of execution (POE) request and it was rejected, you can't become eligible again. (When a POE is rejected, email is sent explaining why.)<br><br>You can request another POE within 90 days of the transaction or earning date. (Be sure to confirm receipt of the POE email when it arrives.) You can also dispute ineligibility within 90 days by contacting support with the ineligibility reason, subscription and customer information, and reason for dispute.|
|China revenue shouldn't belong to non-China partner|No|Partner can't become eligible again by policy.|
| Customer already accounted for in past customer adds earnings | No | A customer that has already generated customer adds incentives won't be eligible for future customer adds incentives for any partner. |

## Exporting data

You can download information about ineligible transactions (but not eligible transactions) from the Revenue summary.
