# Sales Advisor opportunities and data

**Appropriate roles**: Executive report viewer | Report viewer

Sales Advisor focuses on producing recommendations that help drive the conversations partners have with customers throughout the customer lifecycle. It uses machine learning (ML) models to provide recommended actions and the reasoning behind each recommendation. The data used in the models combines insights about the customer such the subscriptions they currently have, and the usage and engagement of each product.

The current machine learning models provide recommendations for growth, retention, and acquisition opportunities.
