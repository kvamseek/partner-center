# Get started with Sales Advisor

**Appropriate roles**: Executive report viewer | Report viewer

Microsoft 365 Lighthouse Sales Advisor, formerly known as Project Orland, is a digital experience that uses artificial intelligence (AI) to analyze a CSP partner's customer base and apply data models—built by Microsoft data scientists—to identify opportunities where a partner can engage with, nurture, and/or grow their customer’s Microsoft 365 usage through actionable recommendations and prescriptive guidance.

Leveraging the same data models and insights Microsoft sellers use for account management, partners can:

- Target customer engagement at the right time with the right actions
- Engage with customers when they are ready for the next step in their digital transformation based on their usage patterns
- Get early warning of customers where direct engagement can avoid future Microsoft 365 churn
- Access personalized marketing content (such as pitch decks), usage information, and more, specific to each customer opportunity surfaced within the experience
- Take advantage of the best-practice recommendations from Microsoft

As of July 2023, the Sales Advisor experience is also available in Microsoft 365 Lighthouse. To learn more about Sales Advisor, go to [Overview of Sales Advisor](/microsoft-365/lighthouse/m365-lighthouse-sales-advisor-overview).
