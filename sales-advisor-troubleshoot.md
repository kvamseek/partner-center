# Troubleshoot Sales Advisor

**Appropriate roles**: Executive report viewer | Report viewer

The following is general troubleshooting guidance for issues encountered while using Sales Advisor.

## Troubleshoot

- Message when viewing Sales Advisor page in Partner Center Insights tab: "You don’t have permission to view the information on this page."
  - **Cause 1**: You don’t have the correct permissions in Partner Center to view the Sales Advisor pages.
    - **Resolution**: Verify that you have either the Report Viewer or Executive report viewer role for one or more MPN location(s) in Partner Center. Global Admin privilege is required to assign these roles in Partner Center. Follow the instructions listed in [Get access to Sales Advisor](/microsoft-365/lighthouse/m365-lighthouse-get-access-to-sales-advisor).  
- Message when viewing Sales Advisor page in Partner Center Insights tab: "There are no opportunities."
  - **Cause 1**: Though rare, it’s possible that Sales Advisor’s propensity model isn't generating any other recommendations for your customer. This means that there's currently no opportunity for you to view or act on.
    - **Resolution**: Check back in two weeks to see if any new recommendations have been generated.
  - **Cause 2**: There's a technical issue in our backend data that is preventing opportunities from being displayed.
    - **Resolution**: Submit an entry to report a bug at [aka.ms/M365SalesAdvisorFeedback](https://aka.ms/M365Salesadvisorfeedback).
- Data or opportunity displayed in Sales Advisor pages seem inaccurate.
  - **Cause 1**: If you see an opportunity with a customer you don’t recognize, you may not be aware of the specific partner relationship you have with that customer.
    - **Resolution**: Submit an entry to request assistance at [aka.ms/M365SalesAdvisorFeedback](https://aka.ms/M365Salesadvisorfeedback).
