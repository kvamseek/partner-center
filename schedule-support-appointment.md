# Schedule a support appointment

**Applies to**: Partner Center | Partner Center for Microsoft Cloud for US Government

**Appropriate roles**: All users

After you have [reported a problem with Partner Center](./report-problems-with-partner-center.md), you may be able to schedule an appointment with a support advocate to meet on a Microsoft Teams call to resolve the issue.

Any Partner Center user can create a support request. Appointments are only available for support requests that you create in Partner Center using your [work account](azure-active-directory-tenants-and-partner-center.md), and are only available for certain problem types and with certain support teams.

## Schedule an appointment

1. From [Partner Center](https://partner.microsoft.com/dashboard/home), select the **Help** (**?**) icon.

2. Select [**View my support requests**](https://partner.microsoft.com/dashboard/v2/support/servicerequests).

   - Find your support request under **My support requests** and select **Schedule appointment**.

6. You'll receive an email about your appointment from *Partner Center Appointments* containing your confirmed appointment date and time in your local time zone. You'll also receive a reminder email two hours before your appointment time.

   :::image type="content" source="./media/support/schedule-appointment-4.png" alt-text="Screenshot of confirmation appointment email.":::

   - *To add the appointment to your calendar*, open the .ics file attachment and save.
   - *To reschedule or cancel the appointment*, go to [**View my support requests**](https://partner.microsoft.com/dashboard/v2/support/servicerequests) in Partner Center. (You can't decline, cancel, or reschedule an appointment in email.)
   - *If you don't receive the appointment email*, verify that your email address is correct on the support request **Details** page.

## Join an appointment

Select **Join your appointment** in your confirmation email, reminder email, or calendar appointment.

You may forward the meeting appointment or share the Teams link with your colleagues if necessary.

When you join the Teams appointment, you'll join the lobby, and the partner support advocate will join you when the meeting starts.

Your support call will be in your selected language, even though meeting confirmation and reminder emails may be in English.

If your support request is transferred to another support team, your appointment might be canceled. If that happens, you will receive a cancellation email explaining why. If the new support team can't schedule appointments, a support call may not be available.
