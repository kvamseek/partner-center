# Use Partner Center to sell customer subscriptions to commercial marketplace products

**Appropriate roles**: Sales agent

As a partner in the Cloud Solution Provider (CSP) program, you can use Partner Center to sell customer subscriptions to software as a service (SaaS) products that have been published to ([the Microsoft commercial marketplace](https://appsource.microsoft.com/) and [Azure Marketplace](https://azuremarketplace.microsoft.com/)) by independent software vendors (ISVs).

This can help differentiate your business and provide your customers with software bundles that address their specific business needs. You manage licenses and subscriptions for these marketplace SaaS products just as you do for Microsoft products.

To learn how partners in the CSP program can use the commercial marketplace, see the [Commercial marketplace overview for Cloud Solution Providers](csp-commercial-marketplace-overview.md).

To learn about the different role of ISVs in the commercial marketplace, see [Marketplace FAQs](/azure/marketplace/marketplace-faq-publisher-guide).
