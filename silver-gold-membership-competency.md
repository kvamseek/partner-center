# Silver or Gold Membership

**Appropriate roles**: Global admin | MPN Partner admin

The Silver or Gold membership program was only offered until 30 September 2022. On 4 October 2022, Microsoft replaced this program with a [Solutions Partner designation](/partner-center/introduction-to-pcs) that offers differentiated benefits and badging for partners. To support partners making the transition to the Solutions Partner designation, Microsoft is allowing them to renew their Silver or Gold Membership (if they held it as of 30 September 2022) until further notice.

> [!NOTE]
> Silver or Gold membership, going forward, is meant to provide the continuity of benefits only. While you can continue to get benefits renewed, it won't provide you with badging since this program is officially retired.

## Silver or Gold Membership FAQ

### I hold a Silver or Gold membership as of 30 September 2022. Until when can I renew it?

Currently, there's no plan to discontinue renewals of the Silver or Gold membership (provided you held it as of 30 September 2022). Your renewal window opens on your Anniversary Date (date of last purchase). You'll be able to renew your membership anytime after this date.

We highly recommend you renew within 30 days of opening of this window to ensure the continuity of your Benefits (Azure credits, Cloud services or Software). In case you're unable to renew within 30 days, you can still proceed with renewal afterwards.

### What happens if I have an active Silver or Gold membership but later qualify for the new program (Solutions Partner designation)?

Microsoft automatically upgrades you to the new program (Solution Partner designation) if you qualify later and if you're an active Silver or Gold membership - at no extra cost. This new program allows you to use your Microsoft badge and certification to grow your business. However, until your Anniversary Date (date of purchase), you're not given the new benefits (Azure credits, Cloud services or Software). On your Anniversary Date, if you still qualify for the Solutions Partner designation, you're given the option to purchase the Solutions Partner designation program.

### I qualify for the Solution Partner designation program, but I want the older Silver or Gold benefits. Are they available to me?

If you qualify for the Solutions Partner designation program, Microsoft only lets you purchase the Solution Partner designation program. There's no option to buy the Silver or Gold program since the Solution Partner designation program includes extra benefits and badging. However, if you think your older Silver or Gold benefits (attained as of 30 September 2022) are more beneficial, you can opt for them.

During your purchase of the Solution Partner designation, you can pick the new Solution Partner designation benefits or the older Silver/Gold benefits. This way, you get enrolled in the new program, receive the associated badge/certificate, gain higher visibility from customers and can pick new or old benefits as needed.

We highly recommend that you transition to the new Solutions Partner designation benefits since they are of higher value and relevance in the current market. Once you make a decision to pick either the new or old benefits, you can't change them until your next purchase/renewal.

### What are the requirements to renew my Silver or Gold membership?

The only condition to renew the Silver or Gold membership is that you have an active Silver or Gold membership on 30 September 2022. You'll be able to renew your Silver or Gold membership during the renewal window that opens after your Anniversary Date (date of purchase). You receive the same benefits as before once you successfully renew your membership.

### Can I renew my Silver or Gold membership if I have the active Solution Partner designation?

No. If you have active Solution Partner designation, you can't renew your Silver or Gold membership because you have successfully upgraded to new program. Congratulations on your progress! You're able to continue making progress in the new program.

### I didn't hold the Silver or Gold membership as of 30 September 2022. Can I newly enroll?

No. Microsoft has officially retired this program and there's no further enrollment. You can't newly enroll in the Silver or Gold membership if you didn't have it as of 30 September 2022.

### My renew button isn't enabled to purchase the Silver or Gold membership. Why?

Go to the **Membership** workspace then select ***Membership offers***. Your **Buy Now** or **Renew** button may be disabled due to multiple reasons. Look at the ***Learn why "buy/renew" is disabled?*** link next to the **Buy Now/Renew** button. To learn more, see [Troubleshooting: Buy now is disabled](/partner-center/troubleshoot-buy-now-disabled).

### Where do I find benefits related to my Silver or Gold purchase?

Your benefits (once Silver or Gold is renewed) are available in the **[Benefits workspace](https://partner.microsoft.com/dashboard/v2/benefits/azure)**. You can redeem them there.

> [!NOTE]
> It may take up to 24 hours for benefits to be provisioned.

### My membership end date, benefits end date, and office subscriptions end date don't match. Why?

There are three different dates that you should be aware of:

- **Membership end date:** 365 days from the date of purchase of your membership.
  
- **Benefits end date:** Membership date + 30 days. We give you a 30-day renewal window and ensure that benefits don't expire therein.
  
- **Office subscription end date:** Office keys redeemed with the previous membership are valid for 365 days from the activation date. However, this date varies depending on how you activated the Office keys during your earlier redemption. This date may or may not align with your membership/benefits end date. To learn more, see [Cloud services](/partner-center/cloud-services).
