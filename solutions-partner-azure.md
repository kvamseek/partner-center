# Solutions Partner for Data & AI, Infrastructure, and Digital & App Innovation

**Appropriate roles**: Global admin, MPN Partner admin

This article describes the *Microsoft Solutions Partner* program for all three areas of Azure:

- *Data & AI*
- *Infrastructure*
- *Digital & App Innovation*

Each of those three areas has its own, separate Microsoft Solutions Partner designation. To earn the Microsoft Solutions Partner designation for one of those Azure areas, your [partner capability score](partner-capability-score.md) must meet the qualification requirements for that area.
Eligibility is determined by your scores for *Performance*, *Skilling*, and *Customer success*, which are measured automatically.

- There are common requirements and thresholds for metrics in the *Performance* and *Customer Success* categories.
- There are separate certification requirements in the *Skilling* category.

To attain a Solutions Partner designation, you must:

- Earn a minimum of 70 points.
- Have one or more points for each of the following five metrics.
  - Performance
  - Skilling: intermediate certifications
  - Skilling: advanced certifications
  - Customer success: usage growth
  - Customer success: deployments

The following sections describe these requirements and metrics in detail.

## Performance

The *Performance* category measures your organization's ability to increase the number of customers who use Azure services and workloads. The metric: *Net customer adds* is the only metric in the Performance category.
## Net customer adds

**Scoring:**

Each net new customer contributes 10 points, up to a maximum of 30 points.

**Calculation:**

```Net customers added = (Eligible Customers last month) – (Eligible Customers same month last year)```

**Eligible Customers:**

*Eligible customers* shows the number of unique customer tenants contributing at least USD1,000 Azure Consumed Revenue (ACR) in one of the last two months from eligible Azure services associated with eligible offers for specific partner association types.

- **Eligible workloads:** All Azure Service Level 2 services are eligible workloads. (Workload eligibility is subject to change. Check frequently to ensure that you have the latest workload eligibility information.) For the list of Azure services bundled at Second-highest level, see [Directory of Azure Cloud service](https://azure.microsoft.com/products/). For example, find **Azure Machine Learning** in the section **AI + Machine Learning**.
- **Eligible offers:** All offers are eligible except *Support*, *Internal*, *Benefit Program*, and *Trial*.
- **Eligible association types:** CSP (CSP Tier 1 and CSP Tier 2), Digital Partner of Record (DPOR), Partner Admin Link (PAL)

___
## Skilling

The *skilling* category uses the number of certified persons in an organization as a measure of partner capabilities and skills.

There are two metrics in this category:

- [Intermediate certifications](#intermediate-certifications)
- [Advanced certifications](#advanced-certifications)

The certifications required are different for each of the three Azure areas, as described in the following sections.

___
### Intermediate certifications

#### Data & AI

**Step 1: Required certifications:**

To earn points for the Intermediate certifications for Data & AI, you must have at least:

- Two people with the [Azure Solutions Architect Expert](/certifications/azure-solutions-architect/) certification.

If you don't meet this prerequisite, you won't earn any points in this metric.

**Step 2: Required certifications:**

To earn points for the Intermediate certifications for Data & AI, you must have at least:

- Two people with the [Azure Administrator Associate](/certifications/azure-administrator/) certification.

If you don't meet this prerequisite, you won't earn any points in this metric.

**Step 3: Other certifications:**

After you complete the prerequisites in step 1 & step 2, you earn intermediate certifications points for every person who has obtained **any** one of the following:

- [Azure Database Administrator Associate](/certifications/azure-database-administrator-associate/)
- [Azure AI Engineer Associate](/certifications/azure-ai-engineer/)
- [Azure Data Scientist Associate](/certifications/azure-data-scientist/)
- [Azure Data Engineer Associate](/certifications/azure-data-engineer/)
- [Data Analyst Associate](/certifications/data-analyst-associate/)
- [Customer Data Platform Specialty](/certifications/customer-data-platform-specialty/)
- [Azure Cosmos DB Developer Specialty](/certifications/azure-cosmos-db-developer-specialty/)

**Scoring:**

Each person with one of the preceding certifications earns you four points, up to a maximum of 40 points.

**Important consideration(s):**

- Steps \#1 and \#2 are prerequisites to Step \#3 and don't add any points directly. However, Steps \#1 and \#2 must be completed before any points are awarded in this metric. Points are only awarded for certifications earned in Step \#3 once the first two steps are complete.

- Individuals can be counted more than once across the different steps, but only once per step. Each certified individual is counted only once toward your points if they have completed multiple certifications in Step \#3. However, the individuals counting toward Steps \#1 or \#2 can be the same or different as the individuals counting toward Step \#3.

- Some of these certifications may have prerequisites listed on the certification website (select on individual certification link). Those prerequisites need to be completed for an individual to complete certification.

**Examples:**

- Individuals A and B complete Step 1, individuals C and D complete Step 2 and individuals E, F and G complete at least one of the certifications each in Step 3. In this case, the prerequisites are satisfied, and three individuals qualify for points (E, F, G), hence you would be awarded 3\*4 = 12 points.

- Individuals A and B complete all three Steps. In this case the prerequisites are satisfied, and two individuals (A, B) qualify for points, hence you would be awarded 2\*4 = 8 points.

- Individuals A and B complete Step 1 and 3, In this case, the prerequisites aren't satisfied, and no points would be awarded since at least two individuals must complete Step 2 before any points can be awarded. Once two individuals (A, B, or others) complete Step 2, 2 individuals would qualify (A, B) and your organization would be awarded 2\*4 = 8 points.

- Individual A completes Step 1, and individuals B and C complete Steps 2 and 3\. In this case, no points are awarded because at least two individuals must complete Step 1 before any points can be awarded. Once one more individual (B, C or others not including A) completes Step 1, 2 individuals would qualify (B, C) and your organization would be awarded 2\*4 = 8 points.

#### Digital & App Innovation

**Step 1: Required certifications:**

To earn points for Intermediate certification for Digital & App Innovation, you must have at least two people with the [Azure Administrator Associate](/certifications/azure-administrator/) certification.

If you don't meet this prerequisite, you won't earn any points in this metric.

**Step 2: Other certifications:**

After you complete the prerequisite in step 1, you earn points towards intermediate certifications for Digital & App Innovation for every person who has obtained **any** one of the following:

- [Azure Developer Associate](/certifications/azure-developer/)
- [Power Platform Developer Associate](/certifications/power-platform-developer-associate/)

**Scoring:**

Each person with one of the preceding certifications earns you four points, up to a maximum of 20 points.

**Important consideration(s):**

- Step \#1 is a prerequisite to Step \#2 and doesn't add any points directly. However, Step \#1 must be completed before any points are awarded in this category. Points are only awarded for certifications earned in Step \#2 once the first step is complete.

- Individuals can be counted more than once across the different steps, but only once per step. Each certified individual is counted only once toward your points if they have completed multiple certifications in Step \#2.

### Deployments

The deployments metric measures the number of advanced Azure services represented in ACR over the last 12 months. An *Azure service* is defined as a unique, top-level Azure workload indicated by the Service Level 2 data for the deployed tenants.
Each eligible deployment contributes two points, up to a maximum of 10 points.

**Eligible deployments:**
*Eligible deployments* shows the number of unique Azure services across the entire customer base contributing more than zero ACR over last 12 months from eligible Azure services associated with eligible offers for specific partner association types.

- **Eligible Azure services:** All Azure Service Level 2 services are eligible except Virtual Machines and Virtual Machines Licenses. For the list of Azure services bundled at Second-highest level, see [Directory of Azure Cloud service](https://azure.microsoft.com/products/).
