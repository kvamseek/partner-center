# Solutions Partner for Business Applications

**Appropriate roles**: Global admin, MPN partner admin

As a *Solutions Partner for Business Applications*, you've demonstrated your broad capability to deliver solutions with Dynamics 365 and Power Platform.

To attain a solutions partner designation, you need to:

- Earn a minimum of 70 points out of 100 points possible.
- Earn at least one point in each of the following three categories and five subcategories:
  - [Performance](#performance-category)
    - Net customer adds: 15 points
  - [Skilling](#skilling-category):
    - Intermediate certifications: 20 points
    - Advanced certifications: 15 points
  - [Customer success](#customer-success-category):
    - Usage growth: 30 points
    - Deployments: 20 points

Your [partner capability score](partner-capability-score.md) is calculated from data that is already recorded in Partner Center.

You can track your progress towards attaining a Solutions Partner for Business Applications designation using the information in this article.

## Classification

Business applications recognize your organization as a partner who works in **Enterprise** or **SMB**. Your organization is measured against different thresholds, depending on which of those classifications you are in, as you earn points in the [Performance](#performance-category) and [Customer success](#customer-success-category) categories.

A partner is classified as Enterprise, if Partner has 5 or more unique workloads contributing more than $5000 in revenue for each customer Tenant in both current month-1 & current month-13.

A partner is classified as SMB, if Partner has 4 or less unique workloads contributing more than $5000 in revenue for each customer Tenant in both current month-1 & current month-13

## Partner capability score for Business Applications

The Business applications [partner capability score](partner-capability-score.md) has five metrics. The sections that follow explain the detailed requirements in each of these metrics.

## Performance category

The performance category is a measure of your organization's ability to increase the customer base that is using *Microsoft Dynamics 365* and *Microsoft Power platform* products.

[Net customer adds](#net-customer-adds-metric) is the metric in the *Performance* category.

### Net customer adds metric

*Net customer adds* for Business applications is the number of [eligible workloads](#eligible-workloads) added to the customer base during the last 12 months.

This metric uses the revenue contribution by your organization on our workloads.

#### Calculating Net customer adds

The calculation for *Net customer adds* is:

`(total qualifying workloads with active subscriptions > 1500 USD latest month) – (Total qualifying workloads with active subscriptions > 1500 USD 12 months ago)`

#### Eligible customers

**Enterprise:**

This is number of unique workloads rolled up at customer tenant level and contributing at least $1500 revenue in a given month for specific Partner association types

> [!NOTE]
> The Workloads differ between Performance and Customer success categories.  The *Eligible workloads* list is growing. Check frequently to ensure you that have the latest information.

#### Thresholds to earn maximum points

This table shows the number of *net customer adds* required to earn maximum points for Enterprise and SMB.

## *Customer success* category

The *customer success* category measures your ability to enable growth in the use of Microsoft products, or in the expansion of Microsoft's services and workloads utilized by customers.

There are two metrics in this category: *Usage growth* and *Deployments*.

> [!NOTE]
> In Business applications, customer success points are awarded based on *[monthly consumption](#monthly-consumption-value)* instead of *monthly active users* (MAU).
>
> Monthly consumption is the monthly number of active users or the monthly active capacity times the consumption rate.

### Monthly consumption value

For Business applications, varied workloads have varied usage units: monthly active users, profiles, and so on.

To enable measurement and assessment of success across all these workloads, the monthly consumption value is defined as:

`Monthly consumption = (monthly active users or capacity) * consumption rate`

See the following table for the current rate card.

*Monthly consumption value* is used instead of *monthly active users* to include capacity-based workloads (such as *Customer Insights*) and to include a workload-based weighting using the consumption rate. This rate addresses the differences in expected workload deployment sizes. The calculation ensures that partners of all workloads can reach the point requirements without including a workload-specific threshold.

> [!NOTE]
> This is not a dollar amount, but a weighted calculation based on active customer usage.

*Monthly consumption value* is calculated at the end of every month.

| Workload    | Rate | Usage unit |
|------------|------|-------------|
| Business Central    | 1000 | MAU |
| Core HR            | 1000 | MAU |
| Common data service (Customer Engagement)\* | 200 | MAU |
| Customer Insights    | 0.2 | Profiles |
| Finance & Operations\*   | 100 | MAU |
| Guides    | 1000 | MAU |
| Power Apps    | 200 | MAU |
| Power Automate    | 200 | MAU |
| Power BI    | 200 | MAU |
| Remote Assist    | 1000 | MAU |
| Retail           | 100  | MAU |
| Talent Attract    | 1000 | MAU |
| Talent Onboard    | 1000 | MAU |

\* Customer Engagement workload includes usage from Sales, Sales Insights, Customer Service and Field Service

\* Finance & Operations workload includes usage from Finance and Project Operations.

For example:

- A Business Central deployment of 10 MAU one month would be 10,000 MCV, given the rate of 1,000.
- A Customer Insights deployment with 50,000 profiles would be 10,000 MCV, given the rate of 0.2.

     Together, these two customers in a customer base would count as 20,000 MCV for the month.

     `(10 Business Central MAU * 1000 ) + (50,000 Customer Insights profiles * 0.2) = 20,000 MCV across the customer base`

> [!NOTE]
> This rate card is subject to change. Refer back to this section for the latest rates.

### Usage growth metric

The customer success *usage growth* metric measures your ability to grow usage and consumption of qualifying products. You earn points in this metric for the growth shown in the monthly consumption value across all of your qualifying customers and workloads.

#### Prerequisites

- **Enterprise**: To be eligible for any points in this category, you must have a baseline consumption value of 50,000 last year (12 months ago).
- **SMB**: To be eligible for any points in this category, you must have a baseline consumption value of 25,000 last year (12 months ago).

#### Calculation

`(Eligible usage last month) – (Eligible usage same month last year) / (Eligible usage same month last year) X 100`

#### Eligible usage

This is total monthly consumption value (MCV) in a given month across entire customer base from eligible workloads for specific Partner association types.

#### Eligible workloads

Eligible workloads include Business Central, Common data service (Customer Engagement), Core HR, Customer Insights Partner, Finance & Operations, Guides, Portals, Power App, Power Automate, Power BI, Remote Assist, Retail, Talent Attract, and Talent Onboard.

All paid customer subscriptions of the eligible workloads are considered for this metric.

> [!NOTE]
> The workloads differ between Performance and Customer success categories. The eligible workloads lists are growing. check these frequently to ensure that you have current information.

#### Eligible association types

- Eligible attributions for Microsoft Dynamics 365 (except Customer Insights) include CPOR OSU, Digital Partner of Record (DPOR)
- Eligible attribution for Power Platform & Customer Insights include Partner Admin Link (PAL)

> [!NOTE]
> CSP attribution is counted in the calculations, however it is appearing as DPOR attribution (display error). We are working on fixing this display error

#### Thresholds to earn maximum points

| Classification | Usage growth to achieve maximum points |
|----------------|----------------------------------------|
| Enterprise     | 30%                                    |
| SMB            | 30%                                    |

#### Scoring

Each 1% of growth contributes to one point (maximum of 30 points).

___
### Deployments metric

The *deployments* metric is a  measure of your ability to grow the deployments of qualifying products. You earn points for this metric based on the growth in deployments of eligible workloads with a minimum monthly usage level.

### Calculation

`(Eligible deployments last month) – (Eligible deployments same month last year)`

#### Eligible deployments

**Enterprise** 

This is number of unique workloads rolled up at customer tenant level and contributing at least 10,000 monthly consumption value (MCV) for specific Partner association types.

**SMB** 

This is number of unique workloads rolled up at customer tenant level and contributing at least 5,000 monthly consumption value (MCV) for specific Partner association types.

#### Eligible workloads

Eligible workloads include Business Central, Core HR, Common data service (Customer Engagement), Customer Insights Partner, Finance & Operations, Guides, Portals, Power App, Power Automate, Power BI, Remote Assist, Retail, Talent Attract, and Talent Onboard.

> [!NOTE]
> The eligible workloads lists are growing. Consult them frequently to ensure that you have current information.

#### Eligible association types

- Eligible attributions for Microsoft Dynamics 365 (except Customer Insights) include CPOR OSU, Digital Partner of Record (DPOR)
- Eligible attribution for Power Platform & Customer Insights include Partner Admin Link (PAL)

> [!NOTE]
> CSP attribution is counted in the calculations, however it is appearing as DPOR attribution (display error). We are working on fixing this display error

### Thresholds to earn maximum points

To maximize the number of points in this metric, you should target the following number of net new deployments.

| Classification | Deployments to achieve maximum points |
|----------------|---------------------------------------|
| Enterprise     | Five eligible deployments             |
| SMB            | Five eligible deployments             |

### Scoring

Each qualifying deployment gives you four points, to a maximum of 20 points for five deployments.

### Data freshness

*Performance* and *Customer Success* subcategories are typically refreshed by the 20th of every month. However, there may be more minor data refreshes throughout the month.

*Skilling* subcategories are typically refreshed within 10 days after certification is completed.
