# Solutions Partner insights

**Appropriate roles**: MPN Partner Admin | Global Admin | Executive report viewer (Organizational level)

The [Solutions Partner page in the Insights](https://partner.microsoft.com/dashboard/insights/mpninsights/solutionspartner?source=docs) workspace shows you details regarding your partner capability score (PCS) in the respective solution areas.

The Solutions Partner page in the Insights workspace has the following four sections:

- [Qualification summary](#qualification-summary) shows the qualification details for all solutions areas along with qualified customer details and metric trends.
- [Customer eligibility](#customer-eligibility) allows partners to verify whether a customer is eligible to contribute towards the PCS score.
- [Skilling eligibility](#skilling-eligibility) allows partners to monitor progress towards achieving the skilling requirements required for all solution areas.
- [Score simulator](#score-simulator) allows partners to check the effect of the changes on the PCS score by entering the details of the planned approach.

## Qualification summary

This section shows a snapshot of the [PCS score](partner-capability-score.md) in all of the Solution areas. Additionally, you can look deeper into the data by interacting with the modals **View Customer details**, **View metric trends**, **Recommendations**, and downloading the qualified data.

## Score simulator

The Score simulator is useful for partners who want to plan the next course of action based on the effect it can have on their PCS score.

Results are based on a simulation. Actual scores are calculated using actual data and consider the criteria based on the respective solution areas.

With **Score simulator**, Partners can:

- Key in Customer details that can be finalized in the future
- Multiple customer details can be added
- Add certification details
- View Simulated results based on the details entered
- View changes in the Actual value and the change in Score

Partners can also:

- View the effect of each recommendation in the simulated result.
- Select multiple recommendations together to view the combined effect.
