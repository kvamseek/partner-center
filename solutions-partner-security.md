# Solutions Partner for Security

**Appropriate roles**: Global admin, MPN Partner Admin

To earn the designation *Solutions Partner for Security*, your [partner capability score](partner-capability-score.md) for security must meet the qualification requirements. The partner capability score is measured by partner [performance](#performance-category), [skilling](#skilling-category), and [customer success](#customer-success-category), and is informed by data that is already recorded in Partner Center.

To attain a Solutions Partner for Security designation, you must earn a minimum of 70 points and must have one or more points for each of the four metrics:
- Performance - Net customer adds
- Skilling – Intermediate certifications
- Customer success – Usage growth
- Customer success – Deployments

Security partners can target providing services and solutions on Microsoft 365 workloads or on Azure services. Therefore, valuation requirements are  focused on both Microsoft 365 usage and performance, and on Azure revenue.

## Partner capability score for Security

The partner capability score for security has four metrics in three categories:

- **[Performance](#performance-category)** category

   - [Net customer adds](#net-customer-adds) metric
- **[Skilling](#skilling-category)** category

   - *[Intermediate certifications](#intermediate-certifications-metric)* metric


- **[Customer success](#customer-success-category)** category

   - *[Deployments](#deployments)* metric
   - *[Usage growth](#usage-growth)* metric


Read the following sections to understand the detailed requirements for each of these metrics. Calculations for Azure and Microsoft 365 are completed individually and then totaled together for the final four metric scores. One eligible customer may contribute points to both Azure and Microsoft 365 calculations.  

___
### *Performance* category

The performance category is used to measure your organization's ability to increase the customer base who is using Microsoft Security products and services. This category is made up of Net customer adds as the primary metric for Microsoft 365 and Azure Security workloads.
#### *Net customer adds*

**Net customer adds** is defined as the number of eligible customers added to your customer base during the trailing 12-month period.

##### - Calculation
Each net new customer contributes to 2 points for up to a maximum of 20 points, obtained from 10 customers.

`Net customer adds = (Total qualifying customers with qualifying ACR in current TTM) – (Total qualifying customers with qualifying ACR in previous TTM)`

##### - Eligible customers

**Azure**:  This is the number of unique customer tenants contributing at least $100 ACR (Azure Consumed Revenue) in past 12 months from eligible Azure services associated with eligible Offers for specific Partner association types.

**Microsoft 365**: This is number of unique customer Tenants having at least 25 paid seats in given month from eligible Microsoft 365 workloads for specific Partner association types.

##### - Eligible Azure services

##### - Eligible Microsoft 365 workloads
Azure Active Directory Premium, Microsoft Defender for Office 365, Microsoft Defender for Endpoints, Microsoft Defender for Identity, Microsoft Information Protection, Intune

> [!NOTE]
> The eligible workload list is subject to change. Consult this list frequently to ensure you have current and accurate information.

##### - Thresholds for earning maximum points

Net customer adds from both Azure security and Microsoft 365 are counted and given points. A total of 10 customer additions from Azure security services and Microsoft 365, fulfilling above criteria, are required to earn the maximum 20 points for this metric. You can achieve points from either Azure or Microsoft 365 or both.

##### - Eligible association types

The association types that earn you points for this metric are

**Azure**: Partner Admin Link (PAL)

___
### *Skilling* category

The *skilling* category measures the capability and skills acquired by a partner through the number of certified individuals in their organization.

For Security, there's one metric in the *Skilling* category:

- [Intermediate certifications](#intermediate-certifications-metric)

#### *Intermediate certifications* metric

To earn points for this metric, you must have certified individuals in your organization:

- **STEP 1**. There should be at least one individual certified as an [Azure Security Engineer associate](/certifications/azure-security-engineer/) (required).
- **STEP 2**. There should be at least one individual certified as a [Microsoft Security Operations Analyst](/certifications/security-operations-analyst/) or a [Microsoft 365 Security Administrator Associate](/certifications/m365-security-administrator/)† (required). This may be the same individual as in Step 1, or a different individual.
- **STEP 3**. Each individual (same as above or different) should be certified in any one of the certifications listed below:
  - [Microsoft Cybersecurity Architect expert](/certifications/cybersecurity-architect-expert/)
  - [Microsoft Security Operations Analyst](/certifications/security-operations-analyst/)
  - [Microsoft Identity and Access Administrator](/certifications/identity-and-access-administrator/)
  - [Microsoft Information Protection and Compliance Administrator Associate](/certifications/information-protection-and-compliance-administrator/)

  † This certification is retired on June 30, 2023. It will remain eligible for partner capability score points through June 2024.

Changes effective from December 1, 2023:

- **STEP 1**. (Prerequisite): There should be at least two individuals certified in [Azure Security Engineer Associate](/certifications/azure-security-engineer/) (required)
- **STEP 2**. (Prerequisite): There should be at least two individuals certified in [Microsoft Security Operations Analyst](/certifications/security-operations-analyst/) or [Microsoft 365 Security Administrator Associate](/certifications/m365-security-administrator/)† (required).
- **STEP 3**. Each individual (Same as previous or different) should be certified in any one of the following certifications:
  - [Microsoft Cybersecurity Architect expert](/certifications/cybersecurity-architect-expert/)
  - [Microsoft Identity and Access Administrator](/certifications/identity-and-access-administrator/)
  - [Microsoft Information Protection and Compliance Administrator Associate](/certifications/information-protection-and-compliance-administrator/)

  † This certification is retired on June 30, 2023. It will remain eligible for Partner capability score points through June 2024.

##### Scoring
Each certified individual gets 6.6 points, for up to a maximum of 40 points, obtained from six qualifying individuals.

**Important consideration(s):**
- Steps #1 and #2 are prerequisites to Step #3 and don't add any points directly. However, Steps #1 and #2 must be completed before any points are awarded in this metric. Points are awarded for certifications earned in Step #3 once the first two steps are complete.
- Individuals can be counted more than once across the different steps, but only once per step. Each certified individual is counted only once toward your points if they have completed multiple certifications in Step #3. However, the individuals counting toward Steps #1 or #2 can be the same or different as the individuals counting toward Step #3.
- Some of these certifications may have prerequisites listed on the certification website (Select on individual certification link). Those prerequisites need to be completed for an individual to complete certification

**Examples:**
- Individual A complete Step 1, individual B complete at least one of the 2 certifications in Step 2, individual C complete at least one of the certifications in Step 3. In this case, the prerequisites are satisfied, and the individual (C) qualifies for points and hence you would be awarded 6.67 points.
- Individuals A and B complete Step 1, individuals C and D complete Step 2 and individuals E, F and G complete at least one of the certifications each in Step 3. In this case, the prerequisites are satisfied, and 3 individuals qualify for points (E, F, G), hence you would be awarded 3\*6.67 = 20 points.
- Individuals A and B complete all three Steps. In this case the prerequisites are satisfied, and 2 individuals (A, B) qualify for points, hence you would be awarded 2\*6.67 = 13.3 points.
- Individuals A and B complete Step 1 and 3, In this case, the prerequisites aren't satisfied, and no points would be awarded since at least 2 individuals must complete Step 2 before any points can be awarded. Once 2 individuals (A, B or others) complete Step 2, 2 individuals would qualify (A, B) and your organization would be awarded 2\*6.67 = 13.3 points.
