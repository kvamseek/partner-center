## Product benefits for each specialization

We have introduced product benefits aligned to specializations and expert offerings. These benefits increase value for partners who invest in demonstrating deep technical expertise and experience in specific technical scenarios aligned to solution areas.

If you already have the relevant Solutions Partner designation and have opted to select the Solutions Partner benefits (and pay the fee), incremental specialization benefits are received when the specialization is earned and will be available through your next Solutions Partner designation anniversary date. The total number of specializations or expert offerings associated benefits must be within the respective maximum benefit cap amounts for each category of specializations and expert offerings.

To see an example of the timeline and maximum benefit cap amounts for receiving the benefits associated with specializations and expert offerings, visit the section titled "**Illustrative example"** in the [Microsoft AI Cloud Partner Program Benefits Guide](https://aka.ms/Solutionspartner.Benefits).

## Renewals

he renewal process is triggered based on the anniversary date of your current specialization. The Specialization renewal process (not including [Azure Expert MSP](./azure-expert-msp.md)) is set to start year 1 in 2023. Check your specialization anniversary date in [Partner Center](https://partner.microsoft.com/dashboard/v2/membership/advancedspecialization).

- **Year 1 (First anniversary of specialization)**

  To renew the specialization, you'll need to meet qualification requirements (such as eligibility, performance, certifications, offer publishing). The qualification requirements are valid for one year and revalidated annually.
  
  Qualification requirements will be reviewed for all anniversary dates beginning February 2023. Renewing your specialization during the first renewal cycle doesn't require any action outside of monitoring that your organization meets the qualification requirements. If your organization meets the qualification requirements, you'll be enrolled upon your renewal window opening.
  
  The audits and customer reference requirements are valid for two years and revalidated every other year. So, for the first anniversary, you don't need to pass the audit or submit the customer references again.

  - **Qualification requirements include**: Solutions Partner, Performance, Knowledge, and (if applicable) Offer publishing in AppSource

- **Year 2 (Second anniversary of specialization)**
  
  To renew the specialization, you must meet the qualification requirements and complete the manually validated requirements (such as audits or providing customer references depending on the specialization).
  
  The audits and customer references requirements are valid for two years and revalidated every other year. This will start with anniversary dates beginning February 2024.

- **Years 3 and beyond**
  
  Subsequent years follow the same process with qualification requirements annually and telemetry + manually validated requirements every other year.

**Reminder notifications**: You'll receive a minimum of three emails to remind you about the renewal of the specialization. Emails are sent at multiple points in time, such as 120 days, 90 days, 60 days, 30 days before the anniversary date, on the anniversary date and 30 days after the anniversary date. These notifications are received by the individual(s) from your organization who has either the "Global admin" or "MPN Partner admin" role. Also, you can see these notifications within [Partner Center](https://partner.microsoft.com/dashboard/v2/action-center/overview).

The renewal window opens 60 days before your anniversary date and close on your anniversary date (with a 30 calendar day grace period). Partners must meet the published qualification requirements within the 90 day period to renew their specialization.

- For the first, third, fifth anniversaries of your specialization (and subsequent odd years), once the qualification requirements are met, the specialization is automatically re-enrolled.

- For the second, fourth, sixth anniversaries of your specialization (and subsequent even years), once the qualification requirements are met, manually validated requirements such as audit or customer references must be met for the successful re-enrollment.
