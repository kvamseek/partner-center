# Customer associations via the Claiming Partner of Record (CPOR) model for Modern Work and Security and Business Applications

**Appropriate roles**: Incentives admin

Microsoft uses the *Claiming Partner of Record* (CPOR) model to manage the associations you have with your *Modern Work and Security* and *Business Applications* customers regarding the following engagements:

- Microsoft Online Service Advisor (OSA)
- Modern Work and Security Usage
- Microsoft Online Services Usage (OSU) - Business Applications
- Microsoft Business Applications Revenue Recognition Association

> [!IMPORTANT]
> Customer Association (CPOR) claims only apply to the incentives *Microsoft Online Service Advisor (OSA)*, *Modern Work and Security Usage*, *Microsoft Online Services Usage (OSU) - Business Applications*, and *Microsoft Business Applications Revenue Recognition Association*.
>
> If you're submitting a co-op claim for another program such as *Cloud Solution Provider (CSP)*, *Managed Reseller*, *Hosting*, or *Surface*, refer to co-op claims process outlined at [Earn cooperative marketing funds](claims-overview.md).
>
> When you submit your claim, Microsoft validates it. We may ask you for more information at that point. We'll also notify the customer of your association request. Customers can decline the association any time. If they don't decline, your association with that tenant and workload will be official. At that point you'll have visibility into the customer's usage data for the associated product(s).

To complete a claim, you need the following information:

- The PartnerID for your entity that makes the claim
- The customer's **Directory ID** or **Tenant ID** (For more information, see [Find tenant ID, domain name, user object ID](find-ids-and-domain-names.md).)
- The **Solution area**, such as *Business Applications* or *Modern Work and Security*
- The **Activity** you've performed and the type of claim you want to make, such as *Build intent - Advisor, Influenced Revenue recognition - Non-Incentivized, Usage recognition - Non-Incentivized, Use or consume*
- Your customer's **Contact name**, **title**, and **email address**
- Your own company's **Contact name** and **email address**
- A **Name** (that you create) for the claim
- The **Products** or workloads you're claiming
- **Proof of execution (PoE)**, such as a statement of work signed by the customer. (You can also download a PoE template to use.)
- For partners claiming revenue association only, the **Dynamics solution seller name**, **Customer name**, and **Name of ISV product/solution**.

You should also understand the following points:

- If you have existing associations with *Dynamics 365* customers, those associations remain valid until the expiration of their subscriptions, and you would have to reassociate if future earnings are expected.
- A customer can have multiple partners, but each workload (for *Modern Work and Security Usage*) or subscription (for *OSA-Sell* or *Microsoft Online Services Usage (OSU) - Business Applications* or *Microsoft Business Applications Revenue Recognition Association*) can be associated with only one partner.

## Create a customer association

To create a customer association, use the following steps:

1. Sign in to [Partner Center](https://partner.microsoft.com/dashboard/home) and select **Incentives**.
1. Select **Customer claims** from the menu.
1. Select the Solution area - *Modern Work and Security* or *Business Applications*
1. Select *Add customer*
1. Select the partner role:
    - *Build intent - Advisor* for Microsoft Online Services Advisor (OSA)
    - *Influenced Revenue recognition - Non-Incentivized* for Microsoft Business Applications Revenue Recognition Association
    - *Usage recognition - Non-Incentivized* for Microsoft Online Services Usage (OSU) - Business Applications
    - *Use or consume* for Modern Work and Security Usage

   > [!NOTE]
   > **Which partner role do I choose?** The CPOR claiming platform allows for CPOR association claims related to Business Applications and Modern Work and Security solution areas. The partner roles that are applicable to each solution area follow. Select the correct partner role based on the descriptions to avoid having to reclaim in the future. Claiming with an incorrect partner role may result in missed eligibility and incentive earnings.

    | Solution area | Partner role | Applicable for |
    |---|---|---|
    | Business applications    | Build intent - Advisor | Select if you influenced their purchase of an eligible product and want to apply for presale incentives. This option is only applicable if the customer purchased these products via Volume Licensing agreement or Web-Direct. |
    |  | Usage recognition - Non-Incentivized  | Select if you drive their adoption and usage of an eligible workload and want to apply for usage incentives. This option is only applicable if the customer purchased these products via Volume Licensing agreement or Web-Direct. |
    |  | Influenced Revenue recognition - Non-Incentivized  | Select if you influenced their selection of an eligible product as a Business Influencer. This option is for revenue association only, not for incentive payments. This option is only applicable if the customer purchased these products via Volume Licensing agreement or Web-Direct. |
    | Modern Work and Security | Use or consume | Select if you drive their adoption and usage of an eligible workload, and you want to apply for usage incentives and/or usage/competency attainment.  |

1. Provide the required details in the pop-up panel such as claim name, select the **Partner ID** of the partner location to be associated with the customer and then add the customer's tenant ID. (For help with finding a tenant ID, see [Locate important IDs for a user](./find-ids-and-domain-names.md)). For Modern Work and Security Usage, if you don't want to earn incentives, select the checkbox to opt out of incentive payments for this claim.
