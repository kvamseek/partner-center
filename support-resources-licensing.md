___

As a Microsoft partner, you might be involved in one or more licensing programs, channels, or agreements.

If you work in the Partner Center, programs include:

- Cloud Solution Provider (CSP) program
- Microsoft AI Cloud Partner Program program

Other licensing programs include:

- Enterprise Agreement (EA) licenses
- Volume Licensing (VL)
- OEM license program
- Software Assurance training or vouchers program
- Open Licensing

Each program has agreements and terms associated with it.
Similarly, products you use might have extra, product-specific license agreements associated with their use.

If you have questions about how these programs work, these resources can help.

> [!NOTE]
> If you need help with more detailed licensing questions or with a customer quote, start with your licensing program's assigned indirect provider (for the CSP program) or your program distributor. They are often your best, initial points of contact for questions about prerequisites, licenses, SKU purchases, or creating customer quotes. If you don't have a partner serving this role for you, see [Find a partner](find-a-partner.md) to locate one.
>
> You can also reach out to your Microsoft contacts to make use of an internal team of licensing experts. If you don't have Microsoft contacts, go to [Partner Support](https://partner.microsoft.com/support/v2/?stage=1) and type **licensing** in the Support page's **Issues** field.
