## Introduction to the Surface Reseller Alliance program

The Surface Reseller Alliance program offers a set of incentives to commercial Surface platinum-, gold-, and silver-level resellers as compensation for the value they deliver and the work they perform in helping us achieve our business objectives for Microsoft. Surface platinum-, gold-, and silver-level partners are uniquely qualified product resellers that have met defined criteria and have been designated by Microsoft to resell selected Surface device products.

> [!NOTE]
> The **Surface insights summary** report is available from the **Insights** workspace. To view this report, you must meet these requirements:
>
> - Have an active Microsoft AI Cloud Partner Program (MAICPP) membership
> - Have an active reseller agreement and valid revenue
> - Have MPN admin permission at the partner global level or executive report viewer (ERV) permission at the partner global level.
>
> Contact your global admin to get MPN partner admin or ERV permission at the partner global level.

## Tiers

The program awards three tiers (silver/gold/platinum) based on the revenue and assessment thresholds defined for the financial year. The logic to calculate and award the tier depends on which thresholds are met for both revenue and assessment combined.

Tiering is calculated at partner location Level. A partner with multiple eligible partner locations sees multiple tiers.

> [!NOTE]
>
> - A lag month is considered for revenue when the tiers are calculated. For example, if you are in April 2023 today, the trailing 12 months (TTM) aggregated revenue is considered from March 2023 to February 2024. For tiering, revenue is considered at the partner location level.
> - Any assessments taken after 4th of the month may not be considered for tier computation and may not show up in the Assessments widget. These will be refreshed and considered in tier computation in the next month.
> - For tiering, assessments are considered at Partner Global level. Partner must meet either the old set of assessments or the new set of assessments or both. If the partner meets one assessment in old set and one assessment in the new set, that will not be considered as meeting the requirements.

Thresholds are as follows:

- **Program term**: July 1, 2022, to June 30, 2023
- **Contract**: Active reseller agreement and Microsoft AI Cloud Partner Program membership
  - Microsoft AI Cloud Partner Program registered member status is available for free

## Widgets

The widgets on the page provide insights that let you view the details of your revenue and provide a deep dive into your revenue trends. Reviewing these charts regularly allows you to identify trends or areas that need attention and start driving toward your business goal. The following widgets are available under Insights:

- Summary
- Revenue
- Assessments by Partner Global ID

### Summary

This widget summarizes the partner information, Surface program related details, revenues and tiers. The table lists down the partner location Name, partner location ID, Contract location where the Reseller Agreement is signed, Authorization Type (ADR/DMP), TTM Aggregated Revenue in USD that is considered for tiering and the final awarded tier.

:::image type="content" source="media/surface/surface-insights-widget.png" alt-text="Screenshot of the Summary widget with one partner location data.":::

Insights are displayed at partner global Level. For partners with multiple eligible partner locations, multiple rows are visible with revenue and tier details.

:::image type="content" source="media/surface/surface-insights-download-data.png" lightbox="media/surface/surface-insights-download-data-lightbox.png" alt-text="Screenshot showing the download data option.":::

### Revenue

This widget displays the TTM revenue considered for tiering and its month-on-month breakdown. The widget is broken down into two parts:

- TTM revenue trend
- Revenue per month chart

Partners with multiple eligible partner locations can select a location from the dropdown to see its revenue trends.

#### Trailing Twelve Months (TTM) revenue trend 

This chart shows the monthly trend of the past six TTM aggregated revenues. Each point on the graph represents the TTM aggregated revenue for that month. For example, if you are in April today, the TTM revenue trend will be shown until February (due to lag month in revenue).

For the February 2023 month, the aggregated revenue shown is for the TTM period March 2022 through April 2023. Similarly for January 2023 month, the aggregated revenue shown is for the TTM period February 2022 through January 2023.

The last point in the line graph displays the revenue of the latest TTM. The revenue considered for the tiering calculation is the TTM aggregated revenue with a lag month. That is, if you are in April today, the TTM considered for revenue is March 2022 through February 2023. This March 2022 through February 2023 TTM period's revenue is used in calculating the tiering for April.

Visit the chart to understand how your TTM is progressing month to month.

The **Silver**, **Gold**, and **Platinum** legends at the bottom of the chart display the tier's revenue thresholds values. The line chart displays a threshold line for the silver/gold/platinum revenue threshold value if your TTM revenue points are close to the threshold values. This is to indicate how close your TTM aggregated revenues are to the threshold values.

#### Revenue per month chart

This bar chart displays the break-up of the latest Training Twelve-months' revenue. On the left are the values that help in understanding the bar chart.

- **Latest TTM revenue period**: The TTM period for which the revenue is being considered.
- **Latest revenue month**: For the selected partner, the latest revenue month indicates the month for or until which the revenue and the trends are being shown.
- **TTM aggregated revenue (USD)**: TTM aggregated revenue is the revenue for the selected partner, from the latest revenue month to trailing back 12 months. For example, if the latest revenue month is February 2023, the TTM aggregated revenue is for the period of March 2022 to February 2023.
- **Revenue (USD)**: The revenue made in the latest revenue month of the selected partner.
  - The growth/decline %age in green/red indicates the month-on-month increase/decrease.

On the right is the Revenue per month bar chart displaying the month-on-month revenue distribution of the latest TTM. Each bar on the graph represents the revenue for that month.

> [!NOTE]
> A month's lag exists between when the revenue is being shown and until when it's being considered. For example, if you are in April today, the revenues are considered until February only.

## Assessments by Partner Global ID

This widget displays the list of individual users across the Partner Global ID who have completed the surface-related assessments. The two pivots display details across New and Old list of assessments. The table on the left lists individual level details while the chart on the right displays the overall count for each assessment. The silver and gold lines on the chart display the thresholds for each respective tier and indicates where the overall individual count stands with respect to the thresholds.

The data displayed in the table includes data from individuals across the Partner Global ID with their name, email, course completion date and the course name.

> [!NOTE]
> All partners in the Surface Reseller Alliance program, must complete the New assessments by December 31, 2023, to remain qualified. If any partner is not able to complete the new assessments by December 31, they'll cease to qualify for the Surface program. However, once you achieve a specific level, it remains intact until June 30, 2024. Old assessments (PC Level 1, 2, 3 and Zero Touch Deployment Training) have been retired as of June 30, 2023. Existing members who have completed these assessments will continue to receive credit until December 31, 2023.
>
> The assessments taken after 4th of the month may not be considered for tier computation and may not show up in the widget. These will be refreshed and considered in tier computation in the next month.
