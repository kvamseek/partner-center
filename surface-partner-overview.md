# Surface Reseller Alliance program

**Appropriate roles**: MPN Partner Admin

> [!IMPORTANT]
> This feature is currently only available in **private preview**.

The Surface Reseller Alliance program offers a set of incentives to commercial Surface platinum-, gold-, and silver-level resellers as compensation for the value they deliver and the work they perform in helping us achieve our business objectives for Microsoft. Surface platinum-, gold-, and silver-level partners are uniquely qualified product resellers that have met defined criteria and have been designated by Microsoft to resell selected Surface device products.

## Applicable tiers

The program awards three tiers (silver/gold/platinum) based on the revenue and assessment thresholds defined for the financial year. The logic to calculate and award the tier depends on which thresholds are met for both revenue and assessment combined.

Tiering is calculated at the partner location level. A partner with multiple eligible partner locations sees multiple tiers.

> [!NOTE]
>
> - The tiering calculations are done by 10th of every month.
> - For revenue, there is a lag of one month. For example, if today is in the month of April, the trailing 12 months (TTM) aggregated revenue is considered from March 2022 to February 2023.
> - Assessments completed are considered till the tiering calculation day. If any assessments are completed after the tiering calculation day, then these new assessments are considered for tiering calculation in the next month.

## Authorization

To view this page, the partner needs to have an active Surface reseller agreement and have the **MPN partner admin** role assigned at the partner global level.

## Revenue

The **Revenue** component on the **Surface** page in Partner Center displays the aggregated revenue from the TTM based on the manufacturer's suggested retail price (MSRP). This value is considered for tiering calculations. The partner can select the partner location dropdown to see the revenue for each partner location. For example, "$1.25M / 2.5M" indicates that the revenue is $1.25 million from the last 12 months for that specific partner location, whereas the requirement is $2.5 million for this tier.  

For revenue, there's a lag of one month. For example, if today is in the month of April 2023, the TTM aggregated revenue is considered from March 2022 to February 2023.

## Assessments

The Assessments component on the Surface page in Partner Center displays two sets of assessments – Retired and the new set. While  retired assessments are retired, the partner will still get credit until December 2023.  All partners in the Surface Reseller Alliance program, must complete the new assessments by December 31 2023, to remain qualified. If any partner isn't able to complete the new assessments by December 31st, they'll' cease to qualify for the Surface program. However, once you achieve a specific level, it remains intact until June 30, 2024. Old assessments (PC Level 1, 2, 3 and Zero Touch Deployment Training) have been retired as of June 30, 2023. Existing members who have completed these assessments will continue to receive credit until December 31, 2023.” Each set of assessments display the number of individual(s) who have completed the assessments in the numerator and the number of individual(s) required for that tier in the denominator. These individuals are counted at the partner global level. For example, "PC Level 2 2/4" indicates that two individuals have completed this assessment when four individuals are required to complete this assessment for this tier. Assessments completed are considered until the tiering calculation day. If any assessments are completed after the tiering calculation day, then these new assessments are considered for tiering calculation in the next month.

## Data refresh

The tiering calculations are done by 10th of every month, and the new values are displayed by the 10th of every month.
