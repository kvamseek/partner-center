# Restore a suspended Partner Center account â€” learn why suspensions happen and what to do

**Applies to**: Partner Center | Partner Center for Microsoft Cloud for US Government

**Appropriate roles**: Global admin

This article explains what to do if your Partner Center account is suspended.

> [!IMPORTANT]
> While your Partner Center account is suspended, you can continue to manage your existing deployments, licenses, and services. However, you can't authorize or resell new licenses or services until your account is in good standing again.

## Why Partner Center accounts are suspended

Microsoft suspends Partner Center accounts for *CSP customers* when:

- Significant account abuse is detected
- Your account profile is in a *failed* or *rejected* state
- The current billing amount is more than 60 days overdue
- Issues affect Indirect provider operations and negatively affect your account (Indirect resellers only)

Microsoft suspends Partner Center accounts for *Microsoft AI Cloud Partner Program Customers* when:

- Significant account abuse is detected
- Your vetting status is rejected for more than 30 days

## What to do if your account is suspended

- If you're sure that your account is current, check your [Partner profile](https://aka.ms/accountexp/legalInfo) settings to confirm that your active information is complete.

- If you're not sure whether your account is current, select **Billing** from the **Partner Center** menu to check your bill. The billing page shows your billing history and trends, the balance due for the current month, links to your invoice and reconciliation files, and your most recent payment.

- If your account is overdue, follow the instructions on your bill to arrange payment, and then submit a support request to reinstate your account.
