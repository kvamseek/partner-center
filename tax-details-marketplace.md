# Tax details for commercial marketplace publishers

**Appropriate roles**: Global admin

This page sets out the tax responsibilities and tax considerations for Commercial Marketplace Publishers (Publishers) and Consumer Marketplace Developers (Developers) in connection with end customer purchases of Publisher/Developer products pursuant to the [Microsoft Azure Marketplace Publisher Agreement](/legal/marketplace/msft-publisher-agreement) and the [App Developer Agreement](https://go.microsoft.com/fwlink/?linkid=528905), respectively.

The information below is in addition to, and not intended to replace, the terms and conditions in the Microsoft Publisher Agreement and the App Developer Agreement.

Unless otherwise noted, the information below applies to both Commercial Marketplace Publishers and Consumer Marketplace Developers that make their products/offers available for sale through Microsoft Marketplaces.

## End Customer Taxation

Each of Microsoft's and Publishers'/Developers' responsibilities for sales, use, goods and services, value added or similar taxes, if any, on end customer sales (**End Customer Taxation**) depends on the country/region in which Publishers/Developers elect to make products/offers available for sale to end customers through the Microsoft Marketplaces.

The table below sets out circumstances and responsibility for End Customer Taxation in countries/regions with sales eligible through Microsoft Marketplaces. The information below is subject to change, and Publishers/Developers are responsible for reviewing this page for current, accurate information.

In **Publisher/Developer-managed countries/regions**, Microsoft acts as an agent or commissionaire (as applicable) of Publisher/Developer. Publishers/Developers acknowledge and agree that Publishers/Developers have sole responsibility to determine all compliance required for, and to manage, End Customer Taxation, including but not limited to registration, tax calculation, tax collection, tax remittance, validation of business status of customers and providing tax invoices to customers. Publishers/Developers acknowledge that, with respect to any sale in a Publisher/Developer Managed Country/Region, Microsoft currently may not be able to provide the transaction details required for Publishers/Developers to provide customers with tax invoices.

In **Microsoft-managed countries/regions**, Microsoft acts as an Agent of the Publisher/Developer. Microsoft assumes responsibility for managing End Customer Taxation, including calculating, collecting and/or remitting certain taxes. For Commercial Marketplace, this may also include validating the business status of end customers by obtaining tax registration numbers or exemption certificates. Microsoft manages End Customer Taxation through either local affiliates or remote affiliates that are registered locally. For sales to customers in the United States, Microsoft, as a marketplace facilitator, is responsible for calculating, collecting and/or remitting sales tax and sellers use tax to the applicable tax authority. This includes all jurisdictions that impose sales tax except U.S. territories. Microsoft invoices under Microsoft's registration number. Microsoft includes any taxes collected from end customers on Microsoft's tax return.

Microsoft makes no warranties that Microsoft's actions will completely satisfy Publisher/Developer obligations in Microsoft-managed countries/regions. For all Microsoft-managed countries/regions, Microsoft strongly recommends Publishers/Developers work with their own tax advisors to ascertain whether Microsoft-managed tax remittance sufficiently addresses Publishers'/Developers' compliance requirements. Doing so is critical for any Microsoft-managed countries/regions from which Publishers/Developers sell their products/offers. Microsoft acts as an agent of Publisher/Developer in Microsoft-managed countries/regions.

In **Reseller countries/regions**, Microsoft acts as a reseller, rather than as Publisher/Developer's agent, in making Publisher/Developer products/offers available for sale to end customers through the Microsoft Marketplaces. Publishers/Developers are responsible for sales, use, goods and services, value added or similar taxes, if any, on the sale of products/offers to Microsoft, and Microsoft is responsible for all End Customer Taxation on the resale to end customers.
