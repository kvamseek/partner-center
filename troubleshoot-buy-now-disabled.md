When you're buying or renewing a Solutions Partner membership in Partner Center, the **Buy now** or **Renew** button may be disabled. Here's what to do when that happens.

## When does this screen appear?

1. Using the credentials for the organization work account, sign in to [Partner Center](https://partner.microsoft.com).
1. Select the **Membership** workspace and then select **Membership offers**.

   The button to buy or renew the membership (labeled either **Buy now** or **Renew**) may be disabled for one or more than one offer, as shown in the following image.

   To learn more about each requirement, select the links provided. For instance, in the given scenario, the partner didn't fulfill the eligibility qualifications for a Solutions Partner designation. A new page containing the relevant information appears.
