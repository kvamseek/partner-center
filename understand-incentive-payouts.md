# View your incentives program details

This article explains the incentives overview page in Partner Center, which shows the overall status of your incentive programs and the status of each program at each location. It also gives the various enrollment statuses.

## Enrollment status

The following table explains the various enrollment states in the **Status** column.

| Status         | Appears when |
|:------------------------------------|:------------------|
| Action required  | The partner has accepted an invitation to enroll in an incentive program but might need to update bank or tax information. See the **Actions required** column for any next steps or links to update your bank or tax information in Partner Center. |
| Discontinued | The incentive program is no longer offered in the incentives system. |
| Enrolled  | All tax and bank information has been validated. No further enrollment action is required. |
| Enrolling  | The user isn't an Incentive administrator, and the enrollment is in the **Action required** or **Validating enrollment** states.|
| Inactive / Ineligible | The incentive program might not be open to enrollment at this time, or the partner doesn't meet current eligibility for enrollment or re-enrollment. <br><br> If the status is **Ineligible**, then the partner doesn't meet the eligibility requirements for the program. Selecting the **See eligibility requirements** link beneath the enrollment status shows the requirements for eligibility and which of these requirements have been met. <br><br> You might also see an **Inactive** status for Partner Global Account (PGA) enrollments that are no longer active in the incentive program.  |
| Invited  | A new incentive program enrollment invitation has been sent to the partner but the partner hasn't yet started the enrollment process. The adjacent **Actions required** column shows next steps and any related links.  |
| Validating enrollment  | The partner has completed or updated bank and tax information for a new or existing enrollment and is waiting for Microsoft to validate the information. During the validation process, **Validating enrollment** might appear for up to 48 hours.  |
