# Update your marketplace owner

If you are an owner of a seller account, you can add new owners to this account by following these steps:

1. Select the particular seller account from the account picker.
2. Go to Account settings > User manegement page and find the user you want to assign Owner permissions.
3. Select Owner role from the list of Roles applicable to Developer programs section.

If you do not have Owner permissions in the seller account, then you can request an update to the owner of their marketplace by submitting the required information in a support request.
