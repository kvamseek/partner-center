# Upgrade Education customers from Windows 10 Home to Windows 10 Education

**Appropriate roles**: Admin agent | Billing admin

## Overview

Cloud Service Providers (CSPs) who have purchased Microsoft 365 A1, Microsoft 365 A3, Microsoft 365 A5, or Windows 10 Enterprise A3 or A5 subscriptions can help their Education customers upgrade from Windows 10 Home to Windows 10 Education, which is designed for both the classroom and remote learning.

Windows 10 Home is now a qualifying operating system for Education customers licensed via the Microsoft Cloud Agreement (through the CSP program). This eligibility, which until now has only been available in Volume Licensing (VL) education programs, has been enabled via Microsoft 365 admin portal support.

## How the upgrade process works

You can help your customers upgrade by submitting a support request on their behalf. Microsoft Support will review the request to ensure that the customer qualifies. After the request is approved, support will provide the Windows 10 Pro Education key to you so that you can then give it to the customer.

When the customer installs the key and the device is joined to the tenant domain via Microsoft Azure Active Directory (Azure AD), the device will automatically be upgraded to Windows 10 Education (subscription).

## Step-by-step process for customers to get Windows 10 Education

You should create a support request and get keys from Support. You can then share these keys with your customers.

### Get keys

Use the following steps to get your Windows 10 Education keys.

1. Sign in to [Partner Center](https://partner.microsoft.com/dashboard/home) and select **Customers**.

2. Select the customer who needs support.

3. Select **Service management** and select **Service requests**.

5. You're taken to the Office 365 portal where you need to sign in using your Partner Center credentials.

6. Select **Support, New service** request from left-hand menu.

    - **Title:** Windows 10 Home to Windows 10 Education upgrade product key
    - **Description:** Requesting [insert number] keys to enable upgrade to Windows 10 Education. (Note that the number of keys requested must be no greater than your Microsoft 365 A3/A5 or Windows 10 Enterprise A3/A5 subscription licenses.) Customer's subscription ID [insert customers subscription ID GUID for their Microsoft 365 A3/A5 or Windows 10 Enterprise A3/A5 subscription.]
    - **Contact number:** The contact number pre-filled. Review it and confirm or update.
    - **Email:** The email address is pre-filled. It should be the email that you use as the Microsoft portal admin (global admin or billing admin only).

8. Select **Contact me**. The expected waiting time is indicated in the **Need Help?** pane.

9. **Microsoft Support** will review the request to ensure that the customer qualifies. Once the request is approved, they'll send an email to the partner containing instructions on how to access the keys.

10. **Partners** share the keys and other instructions with their customers.

### Customer applies the upgrade

To upgrade Windows 10 Home using a Windows 10 Pro Education product key, your customer must:

1. Select **Start**, then select **Settings** > **Update & Security** > **Activation**. Select **Change product key**, and then enter the 25-character Windows 10 Pro product key. Select **Next** to start the upgrade to Windows 10 Pro.

2. When the device is joined to the tenant domain (via Azure AD), the device will be automatically upgraded to Windows 10 Education.

## Frequently asked questions (FAQ)

**Which customers are eligible?**
CSP customers who qualify as academic and have active Windows 10 Enterprise A3/A5 or Microsoft 365 A1/A3/A5 license subscriptions can upgrade their Windows 10 Home devices to Windows 10 Education. Direct other Education customers who license these offers through Volume Licensing (VL) to the Volume Licensing Service Center (VLSC).

**Can my Volume Licensing customers use this process?**
No, eligible VL customers who license through Enrollment for Education Solutions (EES), Open Value Subscription for Education Solutions (OVS-ES), and School should go to [VLSC](https://www.microsoft.com/Licensing/servicecenter/default.aspx) to download products and keys.

**My customer needs more keys than originally requested. How can I get them?**
You can submit another support request for keys for your customer's Windows 10 Home devices. The total quantity across multiple requests should be no greater than their total active licenses of Microsoft 365 A1/A3/A5 or Windows 10 Enterprise A3/A5 subscriptions.

### My customer is about to buy more Windows 10 Home devices. Can they get more upgrades?

Education customers should consider low-cost Windows 10 Education devices through our [Shape the Future](https://www.microsoft.com/education/products/windows/shapethefuture.aspx) program and eliminate the need to upgrade Windows 10 Home devices. If they do purchase more Windows 10 Home devices, partners must submit a new support request via the Microsoft admin portal.

**Is there a deadline for when to contact Support and receive the upgrade key?**
The Windows 10 Education upgrade is based on the customer's active Microsoft 365 A1/A3/A5 or Windows 10 Enterprise A3/A5 license subscriptions. If the customer doesn't extend or renew the subscription, the eligibility to upgrade also ends.
