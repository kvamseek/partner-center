# Assign user roles and permissions

**Appropriate roles**: Owner | Manager

In order to access capabilities related to marketplace or your developer account, you need to have one or more of the following roles assigned to yourself. Each role has a specific set of permissions to perform certain functions within the account.

| Role | Description |
| ------------ | ------------- |
| Owner | When a publisher account is created, an ownership role is assigned to the partner.<br><br>Permission details:<br><br>&#10004;&#160;&#160;Complete ownership of the account.<br>&#10004;&#160;&#160;Add any type of users<br>&#10004;&#160;&#160;Complete payout and tax information<br>&#10004;&#160;&#160;View feedback reports and summaries<br>&#10004;&#160;&#160;Enroll the publisher account into any other developer programs |

> [!NOTE]
> For the commercial marketplace program, the Global admin, Business Contributor, Financial Contributor, and Marketer roles are not used. Assigning these roles to users has no effect. Only the Manager and Developer roles grant permissions to users.

For more information about managing roles and permissions in other areas of Partner Center, such as Azure Active Directory (AD), Cloud Solution Provider (CSP), Control Panel Vendor (CPV), Guest users, or Microsoft AI Cloud Partner Program, see [Assign users roles and permissions in Partner Center](permissions-overview.md).

> [!NOTE]
> Any user management, role assignment activities done on these lines will be in context of the account you are viewing in the **Account settings** workspace. Refer to section on switching between seller if you need to manage a different account.
