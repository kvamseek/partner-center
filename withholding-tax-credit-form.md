# Submit withholding tax

**Appropriate roles**: Account admin | Billing admin

## Overview

Cloud Solution Provider (CSP) partners in some countries/regions receive invoices with amounts that include taxes. Some of those partners pay their local tax authority instead of Microsoft.

If you do pay your local tax authority, you need to submit a tax withholding request—including your tax certificate—to clear the taxed amount from previous invoices.

> [!IMPORTANT]
> Partners can submit withholding tax requests only for *partially paid* invoices.
>
> For fully paid or unpaid invoices, submit the WHT request by [opening a ticket with Microsoft support]( https://partner.microsoft.com/support/v2/?stage=2&topicid=9227afa6-babf-3917-acee-67db7860f5ed) with the following information included:
>
> - A completed copy of the [Withholding Tax Credit Form](https://download.microsoft.com/download/a/a/f/aaf8306b-79d4-455b-975f-41ce9e67b9cb/wht%20credit%20form%20-%20global.docx) (filled out)
> - A signed or scanned copy of the Withholding Tax Certificate or Receipt

These cleared amounts are reflected in the **Last payment** column on the **Billing page** in Partner Center.

## Submit a tax withholding request

To submit a new tax withholding:

1. Sign in to [Partner Center](https://partner.microsoft.com/dashboard/home) and select **Billing**.

2. Select **Billing history**.

3. Select **Submit new** next to the invoice that you want to submit a clearance for.

   The **Submit new** link takes you to the **New tax withholding request** page.

4. Review the invoice details to ensure that you're submitting the request for the correct invoice.

5. Enter the **Withholding total** under **Tax withholding details**.

   **Withholding total** is the amount you expect to be credited.

6. **Attach** a tax certificate.

    You must include a **digital copy** of your **withholding tax certificate** in your tax withholding request. You receive this certificate from your local tax agency when you pay your taxes to your local tax authority. The invoice tax amount in the withholding tax certificate must match total amount in your tax withholding request.

    (Partners submitting German tax withholding requests must submit a hard copy of their tax withholding request. See [German tax withholding](#german-tax-withholding).)

   > [!IMPORTANT]
   >
   > - Amount totals must match the invoice line item from the attached tax certificate.
   > - The attached digital copy of tax certificate files must be a PDF, JPEG, PNG, or GIF.
   > - File names must not contain spaces or special characters.
   > - File sizes cannot exceed 1 MB.

7. **Submit** the tax withholding request.

- Your submitted request is either approved or it's sent back to you if corrections are needed.

- If your request is sent back to you, you can change the withholding amount and replace the certificate if there's a problem with it.

- You can view the request ID and status of your requests in the **Billing history** where you submitted the new request from.

## Update request and resubmit

The review team might require you to make corrections and resubmit a request before it can be approved. If they do, they'll change the status to **Pending partner action**.

To correct and resubmit the request, use the following steps:

1. Sign in to [Partner Center](https://partner.microsoft.com/dashboard/home) and select **Billing**.

2. Select **Billing history**.

3. Find tax withholding request.

   Requests that need attention have a status of **Pending partner action.**

4. Select the tax withholding request ID and status, which takes you to the request's page.

5. Under **Status** select **Update and resubmit**.

6. Read the reviewers' comments that describe what needs to be changed.

7. Make the corrections by either resubmitting an updated certificate or adjusting the withholding amounts.

8. **Submit** the request.

   Submitting the request sends it back to the review team where they'll either approve it or ask for more changes.

### Approved requests

Approved tax withholding requests are executed against your next invoice, writing off the owed amount.

Requests that are flagged as **Completed** are applied within 10 business days.

Cleared amounts are reflected on the **Billing** page **Billing history** section.

The amounts cleared appear in the **Last payment** column next to the invoice the request was submitted towards.

> [!IMPORTANT]
> Previous invoices are not regenerated or reissued. The clearance amount is simply applied to the previous month's payments.

Processing tax withholding requests takes about two days if the tax certificate and the amount are correct. If changes are required, processing takes longer because corrections must be made and resubmitted.

If you have questions about the withholding tax credit request process, submit a request to Partner support. You'll need the tax withholding request ID to resolve questions.

## German tax withholding

Partners who submit German tax withholding requests must mail hard copies of their withholding tax certificate to the following address:

ATTN: EOC Tax Team Marianne Gannon
Microsoft EMEA Operations Centre
One Microsoft Place,
South County Business Park
Leopardstown, Dublin 18, Ireland

## Questions and assistance about tax withholding requests

Partners should use the process described previously to submit new requests. They shouldn't use support requests. However, partners with questions about tax withholding requests can [submit support requests](https://partner.microsoft.com/dashboard/v2/support/servicerequests/create?stage=2&topicid=9227afa6-babf-3917-acee-67db7860f5ed).

Support requests are intended to help partners for existing requests, so they must have their **Request ID** to submit a new request.

> [!IMPORTANT]
> Partners don't need to contact support if their request status is **Completed**. This status appears in the **Billing history** next to the invoice for the submission. **Last payment** amounts next to the invoice reflect the tax withholding amount within ten days after the request is marked as **Completed**.

> [!IMPORTANT]
> If **more than one invoice** is generated in a month for **different billing periods**, you can combine the withholding tax receipts for those periods and submit them **as one receipt** in the Partner Center.
