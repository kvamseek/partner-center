# Ways you can work with other partners in Partner Center

**Appropriate roles**: Account admin

Microsoft's Cloud Solution Provider (CSP) program offers opportunities for partners to work together in various ways, including [indirect provider-indirect reseller](#indirect-provider-indirect-reseller-model), [multi-partner support](#multi-partner-support), and [multi-channel support](#multi-channel-support).

## Indirect provider-indirect reseller model

In the *indirect provider-indirect reseller* model, also known as the two-tier model, indirect providers and indirect resellers work together to sell Microsoft cloud-based services to organizations in multiple locales, verticals, and industries.

### Indirect providers

*Indirect providers* (also known as distributors) purchase products and subscriptions directly from Microsoft and then offer these solutions to customers through resellers.

Working with indirect resellers allows providers to expand their reach and customer base.

If you're an approved indirect provider in CSP, see [Learn how to partner with indirect providers in the Cloud Solution Provider program](indirect-provider-tasks-in-partner-center.md) to learn more about connecting with indirect resellers and customers.

### Indirect resellers

*Indirect resellers* work with indirect providers, who have a direct relationship with Microsoft and have the infrastructure to provide customer support and billing.

Partnering with indirect providers allows indirect resellers to work with experienced technology providers to go to market without having to make a large capital investment, and to offer a broader portfolio of Microsoft solutions.

If you're an indirect reseller or if you're interested in enrolling in CSP as an indirect reseller, see [Learn how to partner with indirect providers in the Cloud Solution Provider program](indirect-reseller-tasks-in-partner-center.md) to learn more about connecting with indirect providers and customers.

## Multi-partner support

Partner Center's multi-partner feature supports customers who need to work with more than one partner. For example, they may want to hire one partner for their expertise with Microsoft 365 but also hire a different partner who specializes in Microsoft Azure. For more information, see [Multi-partner support for customers who want to work with more than one partner](multipartner.md).

Multi-partner support is also available with Microsoft's national cloud offerings.

## Multi-channel support

Partner Center's multi-channel feature supports scenarios when a customer wants to hire a partner to provision and support a subscription they purchased elsewhere. For more information, see [Multi-channel support](multichannel.md).

Multi-channel support is also available with Microsoft's national cloud offerings.

> [!IMPORTANT]
> A partner in the CSP program cannot resell online services to another partner in the CSP program currently. This restriction only applies to the tenant used for conducting CSP transactions. CSP partners who use a non-CSP tenant for their corporate usage can purchase online services from another CSP partner. Microsoft continuously reviews the policies and capabilities of all programs. Any news about feature releases or policy changes will be announced through the usual communications channels, including [Partner Center announcements](announcements/index.md).
